/**
 * The arithmetic behind the doodle surface's arrow and text tools.
 *
 * Pure by construction: no DOM, no canvas context, no design tokens. The
 * component measures the world — pointer positions, resolved token values, the
 * width of a string in the font the canvas actually has — and feeds numbers in.
 * That split is the whole point. Arrowhead barbs and greedy line breaking are
 * exactly the kind of code that is subtly wrong for months (a head that grows
 * past its own shaft, a word that never breaks and runs off the bitmap) and
 * exactly the kind that a unit test pins in ten lines, but only if it is not
 * tangled up with `getComputedStyle` and `CanvasRenderingContext2D`.
 *
 * The one thing this module deliberately does NOT know is how to measure text.
 * Text width depends on the font the canvas resolved, which depends on tokens,
 * which depends on the DOM. So `wrapLines` takes a `measure` callback: the
 * caller passes `ctx.measureText`, a test passes a fake with known widths, and
 * the wrapping algorithm — the part with the off-by-one in it — is testable
 * without a canvas at all.
