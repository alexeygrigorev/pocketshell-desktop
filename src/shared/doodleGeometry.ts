/**
 * The arithmetic behind the doodle surface's arrow and text tools.
 *
 * Pure by construction: no DOM, no canvas context, no design tokens. The
 * component measures the world — pointer positions, resolved token values, the
 * width of a string in the font the canvas actually has — and feeds numbers in.
 * That split is the whole point. Arrowhead barbs and greedy line breaking are
 * exactly the kind of code that is subtly wrong for months (a head that grows
 * past its own shaft, a word that never breaks and runs off the bitmap) and
 * exactly the kind that a unit test pins in ten lines, but only if it is not
 * tangled up with `getComputedStyle` and `CanvasRenderingContext2D`.
 *
 * The one thing this module deliberately does NOT know is how to measure text.
 * Text width depends on the font the canvas resolved, which depends on tokens,
 * which depends on the DOM. So `wrapLines` takes a `measure` callback: the
 * caller passes `ctx.measureText`, a test passes a fake with known widths, and
 * the wrapping algorithm — the part with the off-by-one in it — is testable
 * without a canvas at all.

   * This is the one number here that a reader will want to argue with, because
   * the house rule is that type comes from the `--fs-*` tokens. It cannot, and
   * src/renderer/fonts.ts already says why in as many words: the `--fs-*`
   * ladder "is a density system — 28px rows, 40px bars" for CHROME, and it tops
   * out at 20px. The canvas is not chrome. Its logical pixels are not CSS
   * pixels: a phone screenshot is annotated at up to 2048px wide and then
   * displayed at a few hundred, so `--fs-300` text would be four screen pixels
   * tall on the sheet and 13/2048 of the width of the exported PNG. A ladder
   * built for row heights has no opinion that is useful here.
   *
   * What text on this surface must match is the OTHER MARKS on this surface —
   * a caption and the arrow pointing at it should look like they came from one
   * hand — and the user already chose that weight of mark with the width
   * control. So size follows width. Family, weight and line height still come
   * from tokens (`--font-ui`, `--fw-semibold`, `--lh-300`); only the SCALE is
   * the canvas's own.
   *
   * WAS 4, borrowed unchanged from `ARROW.headRatio`, and that borrowing is
   * exactly what was wrong: an arrowhead is a shape and reads fine when the
   * sheet is shrunk, while type stops being type. The sheet is ALWAYS shrunk.
   * The doodle lives in an `md` OverlayPanel — `min(720px, 92vw)` less the
   * panel border and the frame's `--sp-2` padding, so ~700 CSS px of sheet —
   * and a backdrop is worked at up to 2048px (`MAX` in DoodleCanvas.vue). That
   * is a display scale of 700/2048 = 0.34, and worse for a portrait screenshot,
   * where `max-height: 56vh` on a 900px-tall window gives 504/2048 = 0.25.
   *
   * At 4x the three mark weights were 12 / 24 / 48 logical pixels, which at
   * 0.34 reach the eye as 4 / 8 / 16 CSS pixels. Two of the three settings were
   * below `--fs-100` (11px), the smallest type the app sets anywhere — the
   * default among them. Hence "for annotations font size is too small": it was,
   * measurably, and at every setting but the heaviest.
   *
   * At 8x they are 24 / 48 / 96 before the floor below applies, i.e. the old
   * ladder moved up one notch with a new top. The default 48 lands at 16 CSS px
   * on screen (between `--fs-400` and `--fs-500`) and is 2.3% of the width of a
   * 2048px export, which is caption-sized on the PNG rather than fine print.

   * the absolute floor of legibility rather than a target, and aiming at it

   *
   * The cost is that the ladder compresses at the light end — 36 / 48 / 96
