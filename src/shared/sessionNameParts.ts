 *  - the directory is UNDER `$HOME`      -> home-relative components joined by `-`

 * the SAME base name. That is deliberate — it is what makes `sessions create`
 * idempotent per folder, and it is what makes the tab-label prefix a property
 * of the FOLDER rather than a coincidence of spelling shared by some of its
 * sessions.
 *
 * @param startDirectory the folder the session will start in. May be absolute,
 *   `~`, or `~/...`; a `~` form is resolved against [homeDirectory] so the same
 *   folder yields the same name whichever form the caller passed.
 * @param homeDirectory the remote `$HOME`, or null when it could not be resolved.
