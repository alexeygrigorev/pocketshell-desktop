/**
 * The `pocketshell agent …` launch line, built from the helper's REAL option
 * list rather than a remembered one.
 *
 * ## What the helper actually accepts
 *
 * Captured from the pinned 0.4.44 fixture image, not from docs — the
 * `--help` output is committed verbatim at
 * `tests/unit/fixtures/v0.4.44-agent-help.txt` and
 * `…-agent-claude-help.txt`, and `tests/unit/agentLaunch.test.ts` asserts
 * this module against those files so a helper bump that moves a flag fails a
 * test instead of a user's terminal:
 *
 *     Usage: pocketshell agent claude [OPTIONS]
 *
 *     Options:
 *       --dir TEXT                      Folder to launch the agent in (its cwd).
 *                                       [required]
 *       --skip-permissions / --no-skip-permissions
 *                                       … [default: skip-permissions]
 *       --config-dir TEXT               … Mutually exclusive with --profile.
 *       --profile TEXT                  Named host profile … Mutually
 *                                       exclusive with --config-dir.
 *
 * Three facts drive every branch below.
 *
 * 1. **`--dir` is REQUIRED.** The desktop used to type a bare
 *    `pocketshell agent claude`, which exits 2 with `Error: Missing option
 *    '--dir'.` — so the session was created, the agent never started, and the
 *    user was left in a plain shell staring at a usage message. That is the
 *    bug this module exists to make unrepeatable.
 * 2. **Skip-permissions defaults to ON host-side.** So the affirmative
 *    `--skip-permissions` is never worth emitting; the only flag that carries
 *    information is the negative `--no-skip-permissions`. This matches the
 *    phone (`SessionTypePickerSheet.kt::buildAgentCommand`), and it means a
 *    host that later changes its default changes ours with it.
 * 3. **`--profile` and `--config-dir` are mutually exclusive** (exit 2). We
 *    only ever emit `--profile`, so the pair can never both appear.
 *
 * ## Grok, and the version boundary
 *
 * `pocketshell agent` on the pinned 0.4.44 image has exactly three
 * subcommands — `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`. There is **no `grok`** there:
 * `pocketshell agent grok` exits 2 with `Error: No such command 'grok'.`
 * (captured at `v0.4.44-agent-no-such-command.stderr.txt`, and still asserted
 * in `agentLaunch.test.ts` so the boundary cannot quietly move). The helper's
 * own repo has since grown a `grok` subcommand, but that work is
 * **unreleased**: no host is known to run it, and this repo therefore has no
 * `pocketshell agent grok --help` capture to pin flag spellings against.
 *
 * This module used to answer that by leaving `grok` out of
 * {@link LAUNCHABLE_KINDS} altogether, and the header used to say flatly that
 * this desktop cannot start one. That is no longer the whole story. Grok IS a
 * launchable kind now and the picker does offer it — but conditionally, per
 * host, and never on the strength of a version number we merely remember:
 *
 * - {@link kindUnavailableReason} is the gate. It is answered from a real
 *   probe of the real host — `pocketshell agent --help`, read by
 *   `PocketshellClient.agentSubcommands` and parsed by
 *   `parsers.ts::parseAgentSubcommands` — for the same reason every flag above
 *   is pinned to a capture: on this repo's record a captured contract has been
 *   right every time a remembered one was wrong.
 * - The direction of the "we don't know" answer differs per kind, on purpose.
 *   Unknown means **yes** for claude/codex/opencode, because those three are
 *   guaranteed by the helper version this app targets
 *   ({@link HELPER_BASELINE_KINDS}) and a probe that merely failed must not
 *   take away three agents that certainly work. Unknown means **no** for grok,
 *   because grok is guaranteed by nothing: launching it on a host that lacks
 *   the subcommand creates the session, exits 2, and leaves the user in a
 *   plain shell reading a usage message. That is precisely the failure the
 *   missing `--dir` produced and precisely what this module exists to make
 *   unrepeatable, so the unknown case has to fall on the refusing side.
 * - The refusal is a *message*, not an absence. It names the version boundary
 *   ({@link HELPER_VERSION_WITHOUT_GROK}) so "why is Grok greyed out" has an
 *   answer the user can act on, rather than a control that silently is not
 *   there.
 *
 * Two things stay conservative until a grok `--help` can actually be captured:
 * {@link supportsSkipPermissions} and {@link supportsProfiles} both say no for
 * grok, so the only line this module will ever build for it is the required
 * `--dir` and nothing else. Emitting a flag we have not seen the subcommand
 * accept is the same mistake as trusting a remembered flag name, and it fails
 * the same way — exit 2, plain shell. See those two functions for the detail.
 *
 * {@link SessionAgentKind} remains wider than {@link LAUNCHABLE_KINDS}, but
 * for a different reason than it used to be: what it carries beyond the four
 * engines — `shell`, `probing`, `exited`, `unknown` — are classifications of a
 * session, not things anyone can ask to start.

 *   — tmux reports cwds that way and `stripTilde` in stores/files.ts exists

 *   directory named `~`. `shellQuoteRemotePath` emits `$HOME/'git/x'`: the
 *   prefix expands, the rest is inert data, and a folder called
 *   `wei'rd $(touch /tmp/PWNED)` still travels as text.
 * - **`--profile` uses a plain {@link shellQuote}.** A profile name is data,
 *   never a path — the host's own discovery produces names like
 *   `Claude (Z.AI)`, with a space and parentheses, which unquoted would split
 *   into three words and fail as `unknown claude profile: 'Claude'`.
 *
 * Flags are emitted only when they carry information (see the header): the
 * host defaults skip-permissions ON, so only the negative is spoken, and
 * never for opencode where it is a no-op.
 *
 * The engine's DEFAULT profile is passed as `profile: null` by the caller,
