/**
 * What a `Ctrl+V` aimed at the PROMPT COMPOSER should do, decided from the
 * clipboard's contents and from nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not four lines inside the component
 *
 * The Ctrl+V-in-the-terminal feature has exactly one interesting decision in
 * it — *is this clipboard worth opening the composer for, and if so, as an
 * attachment or as text?* — and that decision has a nasty failure mode: a
 * clipboard the composer cannot do anything with must leave the screen exactly
 * as it was. An empty composer that pops open because the user copied a chunk
 * of rich-text formatting is worse than nothing happening at all, because the
 * user then has to put it away again.
 *
 * Everything around that decision is unavoidably impure — `navigator.clipboard`
 * needs a permission and a real browser, `getType()` hands back a `Blob`, the
 * staging path talks to SFTP. The decision itself needs none of that: it is a
 * function of the mime types present and whether there is any text. So it lives
 * here, where a test can enumerate every clipboard shape in a few lines instead
 * of building a fake `ClipboardItem` for each one.
 *
 * ## The line between "attach" and "type"
 *
 * `PromptComposer.onPaste` — the handler this feature deliberately reuses
 * rather than reimplementing — draws it by asking the ClipboardEvent for
 * `clipboardData.files`: if the platform materialised files, they become tiles
 * and the paste is cancelled; otherwise the textarea takes the text natively.
 * There is no ClipboardEvent on a synthesised read, so the same line has to be
 * drawn from mime types, and this is where the two definitions are kept
 * honest with each other.
 *
 * BINARY FAMILIES ATTACH: `image/*` (the whole point — a screenshot),
 * `application/*` (PDFs, archives, office documents), `audio/*` and `video/*`
 * (a voice memo is an ordinary thing to hand a coding agent; see the audio
 * block in src/main/attachments/mimeTypes.ts). `text/*` NEVER attaches: the
 * clipboard carries the same content as plain text alongside it, and text in
 * the draft is what the user can actually edit. That single rule is also what
 * disposes of the "unstageable type" case: a rich copy out of a browser carries
 * `text/html` and `text/plain`, so it types; a copy that somehow carries
 * `text/html` and nothing else has no text to type and produces nothing.

/**
 * The clipboard as it looked when it was read, reduced to the two facts the
 * decision needs.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the `ClipboardItem[]` itself. Holding the real items here
 * would drag a DOM type into a module that both TS projects compile, and would
 * tempt the decision into calling `getType()` — an async read of possibly many
 * megabytes — while it is still deciding whether to do anything at all.

 * filename into the draft would be two results for one keystroke. It is the

 * so the text never lands — expressed against mime types instead of against a
 * `FileList`.
 *
 * Whitespace-only text counts as text, deliberately, even though `isEmpty` in
 * the composer treats a whitespace draft as nothing worth keeping. The two
 * questions are different: that guard asks "may this vanish without telling
 * anyone", while this one asks "did the user ask for something". They pressed
 * the key with spaces on the clipboard; they get spaces.
