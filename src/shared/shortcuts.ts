/**
 * Every keyboard chord this app claims, as DATA.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The user asked, in as many words: "i also want to see the shortcuts and make
 * them configurable because I asked you about them but I don't know what we
 * have". That is not a feature request so much as a bug report about the
 * repository. Chords accumulated one commit at a time — the clipboard pair,
 * then the typing intercept, then the composer's toggle and its size ladder,
 * then Ctrl+S/L/F in Files, then the zoom fix, then tab cycling — and each one
 * was justified in a comment beside the `if` that implemented it. Several were
 * chosen by asking "what is already taken?", and the answer to that question
 * lived in a conversation rather than anywhere a later reader could check it.
 * FilesView's own comment is the proof: it states that the composer's chords
 * "are not live on this tab, which hides the composer entirely", and that is
 * false — the composer registers its handler on `window` with `capture: true`
 * in `onMounted`, and the workspace keeps it MOUNTED behind a `v-show` while a
 * Files tab is showing, precisely so a tab switch cannot cost a draft. The
 * chord is live; only the panel it toggles is invisible. A mental map cannot
 * catch that. A table can.
 *
 * So: one module, one list, and every call site consults it. That is what makes
 * the Settings screen truthful rather than a second copy of the truth, and it
 * is what stops the NEXT chord being picked against a stale memory of this one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT A "CHORD" IS HERE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `Ctrl` in this file always means Ctrl-OR-Command. Every existing call site
 * spells the test `e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey`, so there has never been a chord in
 * this app that distinguished them, and inventing the distinction now would
 * make the registry disagree with the code it is supposed to describe.
 * {@link formatChordParts} renders it as `Cmd` on macOS purely for display.
 *
 * Matching is on `KeyboardEvent.key`, not on `code`, for the reason spelled out
 * at length in `src/shared/zoomKeys.ts`: `key` is the character the user's
 * LAYOUT actually produced, and matching physical positions turns an unrelated
 * character into a shortcut the moment somebody uses a non-US keyboard. The one
 * documented exception in this app — the numeric keypad's `+`/`-`/`0` — belongs
 * to the zoom matcher, which is a main-process concern and stays there; this
 * registry names those chords for the LIST without claiming to be their
 * implementation. See {@link ShortcutSpec.owner}.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SHIFTED-PUNCTUATION CAVEAT, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Because matching is on `key`, Shift changes the key of a punctuation chord:
 * Ctrl+Shift+` arrives as `{ key: '~', shift: true }`, not as
 * `{ key: '`', shift: true }`. A chord captured from a real keypress therefore
 * round-trips exactly — capture and match read the same field — but a chord
 * TYPED into a config file as `Ctrl+Shift+\`` would never fire. That is why the
 * rebinding UI captures a keypress instead of accepting typed text, and why
 * {@link parseChord} is tolerant rather than clever: it is a loader for values
 * this app produced, not a parser for a keybinding language.
 */

 * The screens a chord can belong to.
 *
 * These are not "components". They are the answer to one question — while the

 * (see {@link surfacesCollide}).

/**
 * Which surfaces are live AT THE SAME TIME.
 *
 * "Two commands on one chord in the same surface must be refused" is only a
 * usable rule once "same surface" is defined, and in this app the surfaces
 * genuinely overlap:
 *
 *   - The composer FLOATS OVER the terminal. Both are live together; that is
 *     the entire design of the panel.
 *   - The composer is also live on the FILES TAB, which is the finding that
 *     started this module. `FolderWorkspaceView` mounts it once, outside the
 *     tab body, behind a `v-show` — so its window-level capture handler keeps
 *     running while Files is showing. FilesView's comment says otherwise; the
 *     comment is wrong and the call-site diff corrects it.
 *   - The Files tab has NO terminal — the panes are hidden, and nothing routes
 *     a key to xterm — so `Ctrl+S` can save a file there while staying XOFF at
 *     a shell. That asymmetry is the reason this is a graph and not a flat
 *     "everything collides with everything".
 *   - Tab chords are handled by ONE window listener in capture, not by the
 *     terminal's custom key handler — that is the only way a single
 *     implementation serves the terminal, the Files tree and the composer
 *     alike, and it is why they work on a Files tab at all. They still
 *     collide with terminal chords, because a tab chord fires while a
 *     terminal is showing and both would claim the keystroke.
 *   - The annotate surface opens over the composer and covers it, but the
 *     composer's window handler is still attached underneath.
 *
 * The relation is symmetric and reflexive; `tests/unit/shortcuts.test.ts`
 * proves both, because an asymmetric collision table would refuse a binding in
 * one direction and allow it in the other, which is worse than no check at all.

 *     exactly what `preventDefault()` fixed in the doubled-paste bug. So these
 *     are BINDABLE, with the standing requirement that the handler cancels the
 *     event.
 *   - WINDOW and APP roles (`close`, `quit`, `minimize`, `reload`,
 *     `forceReload`, `toggleDevTools`, `togglefullscreen`) are handled by the
 *     menu itself, and `preventDefault()` in the renderer does not reach it.
 *     Binding an app command to one of these gets you the command AND the role
 *     — the window closes, the page reloads — so they are refused.
 *   - ZOOM roles are a third case: the app already disarmed them from the main

 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PREMISE THIS FUNCTION WAS ASKED TO ENCODE IS FALSE, AND SAYING SO IS THE
 * POINT OF HAVING IT IN CODE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The tab chords were briefed as affordable because "terminals cannot encode
 * most Ctrl+digit or Ctrl+Tab". Measured against the xterm this app actually
 * ships — @xterm/xterm 6, `src/common/input/Keyboard.ts::evaluateKeyboardEvent`
 * — that is not true:
 *
 *   - `Ctrl+Tab` is `HT`. `case 9` is reached before the ctrl branch and is
 *     gated only on Shift, so Ctrl is simply ignored: Tab produces `	` and
 *     Ctrl+Shift+Tab produces `ESC [ Z`. At a shell prompt that is completion.
 *   - `Ctrl+3`..`Ctrl+8` are C0 controls — keyCodes 51-55 map to
 *     `ESC`, `FS`, `GS`, `RS`, `US`, and 56 to `DEL`. `Ctrl+3` in particular is
 *     a widely used stand-in for Escape. Only `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+2` and `Ctrl+9`
 *     genuinely encode nothing.
 *   - `Ctrl+Shift+<arrow>` is a modified CSI sequence, not nothing.
 *   - `Ctrl+Shift+2` is `@` is `NUL`, and `Ctrl+Shift+-` is `_` is `US` — those
 *     two run in a branch matched on the CHARACTER, after Shift has changed it.
 *     `zoomKeys.ts` already refuses `Ctrl+Shift+-` as a zoom-out spelling for
 *     exactly this reason.
 *
 * What IS free is `Ctrl+Shift+<letter>`: every branch that could encode it
 * demands `!ev.shiftKey`, and the character fallback demands `!ev.ctrlKey`. So
 * the app's Shift-wearing chords cost the shell nothing, and the tab chords do
 * cost it something. Both facts belong in the list rather than in a belief.
 *

 * branch tests `ctrlKey` specifically, so the Cmd spelling of the same chord
