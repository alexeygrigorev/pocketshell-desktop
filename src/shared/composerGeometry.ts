/**
 * The prompt composer's box: where the card sits in the session pane and how
 * big it is. Pure arithmetic, no DOM — the component measures the pane and
 * feeds the numbers in, which is what makes every rule here unit-testable
 * (docs/COMPOSER.md §21.1).
 *
 * COORDINATE SPACE. Everything is measured against `.composer-dock`, which is
 * the session body inset by `--composer-inset` on all four sides. The card can
 * therefore never touch the pane's edges, and — the reason the inset lives in
 * CSS on the dock rather than as a number in here — the JS never has to know
 * what the inset is. `{ right: 0, bottom: 0 }` IS the resting corner.
 *
 * The card is a pure OVERLAY: the pane it floats in is the whole terminal, and
 * nothing here reserves any of it. The one place the card may not go is the
 * small corner box the fixed open/close toggle occupies — `PaneBox.keepOut`
 * below — because a card that could be dragged on top of the control that
 * closes it would be a trap.
 *
 * WHY right/bottom AND NOT left/top. The card's home is the bottom-right
 * corner: that is where it starts, where the collapsed pill lives, and where
 * `defaultGeometry()` returns it to. Storing the offsets from that same corner
 * means the resting state is two zeroes rather than arithmetic over the pane
 * size, and a pane that gets SHORTER carries the card up with its bottom edge
 * instead of pushing it out of sight. The left/top edges are derived when a
 * resize needs them.
