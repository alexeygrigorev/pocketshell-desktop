/**
 * The folder workspace's tab model, as pure functions (docs/WORKSPACE.md §3).
 *
 * Everything the tab bar decides — what a tab is called, what order the tabs
 * sit in, how two tabs that want the same name are told apart — is decided
 * here, with no Vue, no store and no DOM. It is separated for the usual reason
 * this repo separates things (a rule with a unit test beats a rule inside a
 * template), and for one specific one: the labelling rule is the part of this
 * design the user described in the most detail and the part a reader is most
 * likely to disagree with, so it should be readable in one file.
 *
 * ## The prefix is the FOLDER'S name, not the sessions' common prefix
 *
 * The user said "we remove the prefix — the prefix is common for them". It is
 * common because every session in a folder is named after that folder:
 * `sessionBaseName('~/git/dtc-website', home)` is `git-dtc-website`, and
 * `tmuxctl`, the phone and this app all derive it the same way, which is the
 * whole point of that function existing in `shared/`.
 *
 * Taking the LITERAL longest common prefix of the names instead would be
 * shorter to write and wrong in the case that matters. A folder holding
 * `git-dtc-website` and a hand-made session called `git-scratch` has a literal
 * common prefix of `git-`, so both tabs would be relabelled — `dtc-website`
 * and `scratch` — inventing a shared identity out of a coincidence of
 * spelling, and renaming a tab whose name was never derived from anything.
 * The folder's own base name cannot do that: a session either starts with it
 * or it does not.

 *
 * The empty remainder used to read `main`, the user's own first suggestion
 * ("if there is no prefix left we can call it main, or just terminal"). It was
 * the wrong half of the offer, and the bar said so: a folder's default session
 * read `main` and the very next one read `Terminal 2`, two unrelated words for
 * two sessions that differ only in which of them was created first. Nothing
 * about `main` predicts `Terminal 2`, and nothing about `Terminal 2` explains

 * `Terminal`, `Terminal 2`, `Terminal 3` is one list with a first element,
 * where the plain label reads as the unnumbered member rather than as a
 * different kind of thing. The user asked for exactly this: "for main let's
 * call it 'Terminal' so 'Terminal-2' makes more sense".
 *
 * The SPACE is deliberate, though the user typed `Terminal-2`. The hyphen is
 * real in the NAME — `freeSessionNameCommand` builds `git-red-stamp-2` and
 * `tmuxctl` joins that string — but this function returns a display label, and
 * a label that mimics the name's punctuation invites the reader to type it back
 * as one. Every other numbered label on this bar is spaced (`Files 2`, and
 * everything {@link numberCollisions} touches), so a spaced `Terminal 2` is the
 * bar's own convention rather than a second one.
 *
 * The digit rule is not a flourish. `freeSessionNameCommand`
 * (src/main/projects/commands.ts) walks `<base>-2`, `<base>-3` when a folder
 * needs a second session, so the remainder of the second session in
 * `~/git/dtc-website` is literally `2`. A tab labelled `2` sitting beside a tab
 * labelled `import` says nothing at all; `Terminal 2` says what it is. The user
 * spelled out the condition — "if it's just a number".
 *
 * Anything else is the remainder verbatim: "if there is a clear name then we
 * have a clear name." A remainder that merely CONTAINS digits (`v2`, `2fa`) is
 * a name someone chose, so it is left alone.

 * under the session store's refresh timer moves the target between those two
 * moments.
 *
 * This used to say it was "the one place in the app that does not sort by

 * The tab a "next tab"/"previous tab" chord should land on, as a pure decision.

 * keydown handler is testable only through a mounted component and a synthetic
 * event, whereas the question this answers — given these tabs and this one,
 * which one is next — is a table.
 *
 * ## Array order IS traversal order
 *
 * No sorting, no re-grouping, no skipping. {@link buildWorkspaceTabs} has
 * already put the session tabs first, oldest first, then the Files tabs, and
 * that is what the user is looking at. A cycle that visited tabs in some other
 * order — kind first, or by recency — would be a second ordering to learn for
 * no gain, and it would break the only property that makes a repeated chord
 * usable: pressing it n times from the first tab must walk left to right along
 * the bar, exactly as the eye does.
 *
 * Files tabs are therefore in the cycle. They are tabs; the bar shows them as
 * tabs; a chord that stopped at the last session would strand the user one
 * press short of the thing they can see.
 *
 * ## Wrapping, and the unknown active tab
 *
 * Both directions wrap, because a bar is a ring for this purpose: the chord's
 * whole job is to get somewhere else with a repeated press, and a press that
 * silently does nothing at the end reads as a dropped keystroke rather than as
 * a boundary.
 *
 * When [activeId] names no tab — it is null, or it is a session that just
 * disappeared out from under the bar — treat the cursor as sitting just OUTSIDE
 * the bar, on the side the user is coming from: `+1` steps onto the first tab,
 * `-1` onto the last. That is the same arithmetic as starting from index -1 and
 * from index `length` respectively, and it means the chord always moves
 * somewhere rather than refusing on a stale selection, which is precisely the
 * state a user reaches for a tab chord to escape.
 *
 * Returns null only for an empty bar — there is no tab to name. A bar of one
 * returns that one tab's id, not null: the cycle is honestly a cycle of one,
 * and the caller re-selecting the tab it is already on is a no-op, whereas a
 * null would make it write a "no such tab" branch for a case that is not an

// Manual tab order (docs/WORKSPACE.md §15)
//
// "I also want to be able to rearrange tabs like drag and drop them around."
//
// ## This overrides an earlier instruction, and only partly
//
// The workspace was specified with "the tabs are always ordered: first agent
// sessions, then files", and {@link buildWorkspaceTabs} enforces exactly that.
// A manual order overrides a derived one by definition, so the two requests
// cannot both be obeyed in full — and the resolution taken here is:
//
//   - **the derived order becomes the DEFAULT.** A tab the user has never
//     dragged sits where §3.2 puts it: sessions by creation time, oldest first,
//     then Files tabs in the order they were opened. Nothing changes for a user
//     who never drags anything.
//   - **a manual position wins once set**, for the tabs that have one.
//   - **the two GROUPS stay separate.** A Files tab may not be dragged in among
//     the session tabs, and a session tab may not be dragged past the first
//     Files tab.
//
// The last of those is the judgement call, and the freest reading of "drag them
// around" says the opposite. It is kept because the grouping is doing work that
// the ordering within a group is not. It is what makes the bar's SHAPE
// predictable — everything before the first Files tab is a live process on
// another machine, everything after it is a file browser — and the tab styling
// leans on it: `.tab.files` is deliberately toned down so the eye can find the
// session half of the bar without reading the labels. Interleaving would take
// that away and give back only the ability to put a file browser in the middle
// of a row of terminals.
//
// It is also cheap to relax if that reading is wrong: delete the clamp in
// {@link reorderTabs} and the groups merge. What must NOT happen meanwhile is a
// drag that appears to cross the boundary and then snaps back, which reads as a
// bug rather than as a rule — hence {@link canDropTabAt}, so the UI can refuse
// visibly while the drag is still in the air.

/**
 * Re-sort [tabs] by a stored manual [order], keeping the derived order for
 * anything the user has not placed.
 *
 * ## Why the stored value is a RANKING and not a list of tabs
 *
 * The tab set is not static: sessions appear on the refresh timer, are created
 * from `+`, and vanish when they are killed here, from the phone, or from the
 * user's own terminal. So the stored order has to be a preference ABOUT tabs
 * rather than a list OF them — if it were the list, it would have to be
 * reconciled on every refresh and every reconciliation is a chance to invent a
 * tab or lose one.
 *
 * As a ranking, all three awkward cases fall out with no special handling:
 *
 *   - **a NEW tab** has no rank, sorts after everything that does, and so lands
 *     at the end of its own group — which is where a new session belongs and is
 *     exactly what the derived order already did with it;
 *   - **a REMOVED tab** is simply absent from [tabs] and leaves no hole, because
 *     nothing is positioned by index;
 *   - **an UNKNOWN id** in the order — a tab that is gone, or one from a
 *     different workspace — ranks nothing and is inert. It is pruned anyway (see
 *     {@link pruneTabIds}), so it cannot pin a tab that comes back later under
 *     the same name.
 *
 * The sort is STABLE and the comparator only ever compares ranks, so two
 * unranked tabs keep their derived relative order. `Array.prototype.sort` is
 * required to be stable since ES2019.
 *
 * Groups are re-established after the sort rather than trusted through it, so a
 * stored order written by an older build — or hand-edited in `localStorage` —
 * cannot interleave the kinds.

 * the removal itself.
 *
 * ## Closing a tab that is not the active one changes nothing
 *
 * The first branch, and the one most easily got wrong. Middle-clicking a
 * background tab, or picking "Stop session" off another tab's context menu, is
 * not a request to go anywhere: the user is looking at what they were looking
 * at and expects to keep looking at it. Returning [active] unchanged is the
 * whole of that, and it holds even when [active] is not in [tabs] at all —
 * a selection that was already stale is not this operation's business to fix.
 *
 * ## The MRU is consulted, then adjacency
 *
 * The user's request: "closing a tab selects the previously active one, not the
 * first". So the stack is walked from the top down, skipping the tab being
 * closed and anything that is not on the bar — the same defensive filter
 * {@link pruneTabIds} applies from the other side, kept here as well because this
 * function is the one that must not be able to name a dead tab whatever it was
 * handed.
 *
 * ## Empty MRU falls back to the tab on the RIGHT
 *
 * Reached on a first-ever close, or after every previously visited tab has
 * itself been closed. The right neighbour, falling back to the left when the
 * closed tab was last on the bar.
 *
 * Right rather than left because it keeps the SELECTION INDEX where it was:
 * closing tab 3 of 5 leaves you on the tab that is now tab 3, so closing a run
 * of tabs from one position walks forward through the bar instead of retreating
 * to the start. That is what every browser and VS Code do, and it is also the
 * direction `Ctrl+Tab` travels, so the two gestures do not disagree about which
 * way the bar runs. Falling back to the left at the end is not a second rule —
 * it is the same rule finding nothing on the right.
 *
 * Returns null only for a bar that had nothing but the closed tab on it.
