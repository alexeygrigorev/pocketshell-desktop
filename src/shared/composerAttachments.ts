/**
 * Pure list surgery on the composer's staged attachments.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not three lines inside a component
 *
 * Staging happens at ATTACH time, not at send time: `AttachmentStager` uploads
 * the bytes the moment a file is pasted, dropped or picked, and the tile the
 * user then sees is identified by the REMOTE PATH that upload returned. That
 * makes "annotate the image I already attached" a genuine replacement rather
 * than an edit — a second upload lands at a second path, and the tile list has
 * to swap one identity for another.
 *
 * The swap has to happen IN PLACE, and that is the whole reason for the fuss.
 * The paths are folded into the prompt in tile order at send time
 * (docs/COMPOSER.md §5.1), so a draft that says "the second screenshot" is a
 * statement about this array's ordering. Removing the original and appending
 * the annotated version — the only thing the existing store actions can
 * express between them — silently moves the image to the end and makes that
 * sentence false. Annotating is not reattaching.
 *
 * Keeping the arithmetic here, pure and generic over the element type, means
 * the ordering rule can be tested without a Pinia store, a canvas or an SSH
 * connection, and means the renderer and the store can share one definition of
 * it rather than growing two that drift.

/**
 * Swap `targetPath` for `next`, keeping the target's POSITION.
 *
 * Returns a new array, or `null` when `targetPath` is not in `list` — which is
 * a real case rather than a defensive one: the upload of an annotated image is
 * a round trip to the host, and the user is free to hit `×` on the tile, hit
 * Discard, or send the prompt while it is in flight. A caller that gets `null`
 * should do nothing at all; re-adding an attachment the user has since removed
 * would be worse than losing the annotation.
 *
 * If `next.remotePath` somehow already appears elsewhere in the list, that
 * other copy is dropped. `mergePaths` in the store guarantees remote paths are
 * unique across the tile list, and this keeps that invariant true rather than
 * quietly producing a list where removal by path would delete two tiles. In
 * practice it never fires — remote names carry a per-second timestamp and a
 * batch ordinal — but the invariant is cheaper to preserve than to debug.

/**
 * Turn a tilde-form attachment path into one SFTP can address.

 * `AttachmentStager` returns display paths like
 * `~/.pocketshell/attachments/main/20260825-101500-01-shot.png`, because that
 * is the form worth pasting into a prompt — the agent reads it through a shell
 * that expands it. SFTP has no shell and no tilde expansion (which is exactly
 * why the stager resolves the home directory itself before uploading), so
 * reading those same bytes BACK for annotation has to undo the abbreviation.
 *
 * `home` is what `realPath(".")` answered on the session's SFTP channel. A
 * path that is not tilde-form is returned untouched: it is already absolute,
 * or it is relative and the server will resolve it against the same home
 * anyway.

/**
 * Name for the PNG a doodle produces, given the backdrop it was drawn on.
 *
 * The interesting case is the SECOND pass. Annotating an already-annotated
 * attachment is supported and is the honest behaviour (the sheet starts from
 * the flattened first pass), but the name it starts from has by then been
 * through two machines: the doodle surface wrapped it as
 * `annotated-<source>-<stamp>.png`, and `AttachmentStager` prefixed THAT with
 * its own `<stamp>-<ordinal>-` on upload. Naively wrapping it again gives
 * `annotated-20260825-101500-01-annotated-shot-20260825-101459-<stamp>.png`,
 * which grows without bound and buries the one word — `shot` — that tells the
 * user which screenshot this is.
 *
 * So both machine decorations are peeled off before the new ones go on. One
 * prefix and one timestamp say everything three of each would, and the result
 * is stable under repeated annotation: `annotated-shot-<latest stamp>.png`.
 *
 * A backdrop with no name at all (the blank sheet) is not an annotation of
 * anything, so it gets the neutral `doodle-` prefix instead.
