 *     tab, an evicted one). There is nothing to check, ever; the renderer
 *     stops probing.
 *   - `dead` — the pool holds a client but tmux could not be asked about it
 *     (the handshake variable never published, the client detached, the
 *     server died, the exec failed). This is the state whose honest naming
 *     matters most: swallowed into a null it is indistinguishable from
 *     healthy agreement, and a pane whose repair path has quietly died sits
 *     garbled forever. The renderer counts these and re-joins.
 *   - `ok` — both quantities, measured. `client` is the size of OUR client's
 *     tty (what `resize` set — the thing our grid must equal);
 *     `window` is the size of the tmux window the client is showing, which
 *     `window-size latest` moves when another client drives the session.
 *     The window is at most one row shorter than the client: that row is
 *     tmux's status line, when the session runs with it on.
