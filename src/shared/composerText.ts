/**
 * Is this keystroke the user starting to TYPE, or driving the terminal?

 * printable key pressed at a CLOSED composer opens it and lands in the draft
 * instead of reaching the shell. Everything this returns false for still goes
 * straight through, and the list of those is the load-bearing part — a terminal
 * that swallows Ctrl-C is broken, and the user still has to answer prompts,
 * page through `less` and drive tmux while the composer is shut.
 *
 * The line, exactly:
 *
 *   - ANY of Ctrl / Meta / Alt held → not typing. That covers Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D,
 *     Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-R, tmux's own prefix, and every app chord in one rule.
 *     Shift is deliberately NOT in that list: Shift-A is a capital letter.
 *   - A `key` that is not exactly one character → not typing. Named keys are
 *     spelled out by the DOM (`Enter`, `Tab`, `Escape`, `ArrowUp`, `F5`,
 *     `Backspace`, `Home`…), so one rule covers the whole keyboard's worth of
 *     control keys without listing them. Counted by code point, so an astral
 *     character still reads as one.
 *   - A bare SPACE → not typing. It is the near-universal "next page" key in
 *     pagers and tmux copy mode, and nobody begins a prompt with it. Only the
 *     TRIGGER is affected: once the composer is open the draft has focus and a
 *     space types normally.
 *   - Mid-IME-composition → not typing. The composing text belongs to whatever
 *     already has focus; stealing it half-written would drop it.
