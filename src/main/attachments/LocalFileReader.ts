/**
 * Reads the BYTES of a local file back into the renderer.
 *
 * This is the counterpart to {@link AttachmentStager}, and it runs the
 * other way. The stager takes bytes (a clipboard paste) or a path (a
 * picked file) and pushes them AT the remote host; the doodle editor
 * needs the same picked file coming back the other way, as pixels it can
 * paint on before anything is uploaded.
 *
 * ## Why this needs its own module rather than a two-line handler
 *
 * `attachments:pickFiles` deliberately hands the renderer nothing but
 * opaque paths ("the renderer never needs filesystem access — it gets
 * back opaque paths it can only hand to `attachments:stage`", ipc.ts).
 * A `readLocal(path)` channel narrows that guarantee: it is a genuine
 * filesystem-read primitive on the privileged side of the bridge, and a
 * compromised or buggy renderer calling it with `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
 * would exfiltrate a private key through a feature whose entire purpose
 * is drawing moustaches on screenshots.
 *
 * So the path argument is treated as the security boundary, and the
 * guarantee is restored in a narrower form: **the renderer may read back
 * only the paths this session's native picker actually handed it.** The
 * allow-list is not a heuristic — it is exactly complete. Auditing every
 * way a path reaches the renderer today turns up precisely one
 * (`PromptComposer.onAttachClick` -> `api.attachments.pickFiles`);
 * paste and drag-drop arrive as `File` objects and already carry their
 * own bytes, and a blank canvas reads nothing. The renderer therefore
 * cannot name a path it did not receive from a dialog the user clicked
 * through, which is the same consent boundary the picker already
 * established. Cheap to implement, no false negatives, so it is
 * implemented rather than waved at.
 *
 * The allow-list is per-process and in-memory: it dies with the app, and
 * a path picked in a previous run is not readable in this one.
 */

/**
 * Per-read ceiling for bytes crossing back to the renderer, 32 MiB.
 *
 * Deliberately well under {@link MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES}' 100 MiB, because
 * the two bound different things. That 100 MiB bounds a *streamed*
 * upload — `fastPut` never holds the file in memory — whereas a read is
 * buffered three times over on its way to a canvas: once as a Buffer
 * here, once as the structured clone the renderer receives, and once
 * more as the decoded bitmap, which at 4 bytes per pixel dwarfs the
 * encoded file (a 25 MB JPEG is comfortably a gigabyte decoded). 32 MiB
 * still clears any camera photo, scanned page or 8K screenshot the
 * doodle editor will realistically be handed, and a file above it is not
 * an image someone meant to annotate.
 *
 * `sftp:readBinary` is the cousin, not a copy: its ceiling lives in
 * `ipc.ts` (`MAX_SFTP_READ_BYTES`, 128 MiB — a remote document may
 * legitimately be bigger than any photo) but defaults to this number
 * when the renderer does not ask for a cap, because the bytes land in
 * the renderer exactly the same way.
 *
 * It bounds the READ-BACK path only, and it is worth being explicit
 * about what that excludes, because the obvious reading is wrong.
 * Attaching a file does not come through here: the composer hands
 * `attachments:stage` the picked path and {@link AttachmentStager}
 * streams it to the host with `fastPut`, bounded by
 * {@link MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES}' 100 MiB. So an hour-long recording or a
 * scanned PDF far over 32 MiB attaches to a prompt perfectly well; what
 * it cannot do is become a doodle backdrop, which is the correct
 * outcome for a file that has no pixels. Raising this number is
 * therefore never the way to make a large non-image attach — that path
 * is already open, and the bitmap arithmetic above still governs this
 * one.
