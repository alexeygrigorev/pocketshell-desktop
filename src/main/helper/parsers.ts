// list asks of every row: *where* is this session, is it *attached*, and *what
// is running* in it. The phone answers all three from tmux directly
// (`FolderListGateway.LIST_SESSIONS_COMMAND` / `LIST_PANES_COMMAND`,
// FolderListGateway.kt:2109-2124) and we mirror that here.
//
// One probe, not two, and not one-per-session: tmux resolves SESSION-scoped
// formats (`session_path`, `session_attached`, and session user options like
// `@ps_agent_kind`) inside a PANE-scoped `list-panes` context, because the
// pane's session is in its format tree. So a single `list-panes -a` yields
// both halves of what the phone fetches with two commands. Verified against
// tmux 3.4 (the user's box) and tmux 3.6b (the helper fixture image).
//
// Field order deliberately puts `pane_current_path` and `session_path` before
// the remaining scalar fields — see FIELD_SEP note below.

/** The `::` delimiter, matching the phone's `FolderListGateway.FIELD_SEP`. */

/**
 * The single companion probe run alongside `pocketshell sessions list`.
 *
 * `tmux -u` (issue #2160): a tmux client without a UTF-8 locale sanitises
 * every non-ASCII byte it prints to `_`, which would corrupt paths and
 * recorded option values on hosts whose sshd exports no locale.
 *
 * Column order is `name, window_active, pane_active, pane_current_path,
 * session_path, session_attached, @ps_agent_kind, socket_path`. Paths sit in
 * the middle rather than last (the phone parks `session_path` last for the
 * same reason) because a `::` inside a path would otherwise swallow the
 * fields after it — here the parser splits a FIXED count of fields, so only
 * the two path columns can be ambiguous and the scalar tail is always
 * recoverable.
 *
 * `socket_path` is the newest column and the reason aimed actions (Stop,
 * rename) can be aimed at all: the ecosystem now runs one tmux SERVER per
 * session, so two sessions can share a name legally and a bare `tmux` sees
 * only the legacy default one. The parser reads the socket from the same
 * positional end as the other scalars, and an old probe that lacks the
 * column simply yields null there — see {@link SessionEnrichment.socketPath}.
 *
 * That reasoning holds, but only if the parser actually splits from BOTH
 * ends, which it did not: it took the first seven fields left to right, so a
 * `::` in a path shifted `session_attached` and `@ps_agent_kind` one place
 * left and both were read out of a path fragment. {@link splitEnrichmentRow}
 * takes the three leading scalars and the two trailing ones by position from
 * their own end, which is what makes the tail genuinely recoverable.

 * socket-less row has (eight once the socket column is present). Reading
 * the first seven then shifted `session_attached` and `@ps_agent_kind` out of
 * a path fragment, which quietly reported the session as detached and
 * agent-less. Only the two path columns are ambiguous, so the three leading
 * scalars are taken from the front, the trailing ones from the back, and
 * whatever is left in the middle is the two paths.
 *
 * Splitting that middle is the one genuinely ambiguous decision here, and it
 * is resolved by what the two columns MEAN rather than by counting: the
 * session's path is the directory the session was created in and the pane's
 * is where its shell is now, so the former is almost always an ancestor of
 * (or equal to) the latter. When more than one `::` sits in the middle we
 * take the split that satisfies that relationship, and fall back to the first
 * `::` when none does — which is the old behaviour, so the common case is
 * unchanged.
 *
 * ## Too few fields
 *
 * `parts.length < 7` used to drop the line outright, which is the wrong
 * default for a probe whose whole contract is "degrade, never cost us the
 * row". A tmux too old to expand `#{@ps_agent_kind}` emits the literal text
 * rather than an empty field, and a genuinely truncated line (an SSH read cut
 * short) loses its TAIL, not its head — so a row that has at least the name
 * and the two active flags still tells us where the session is. Missing
 * trailing fields are treated as empty; a row with fewer than five fields
 * carries no path at all and is still skipped, along with header noise and
