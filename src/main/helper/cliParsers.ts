 *
 * Written for `pocketshell agent --help`, which is how the app finds out
 * whether a host can launch a given engine. Asking the help text rather than
 * comparing `pocketshell --version` against a remembered table is the same
 * choice made everywhere else in this file: the helper is a separately
 * released project, this repo has been wrong about its documented contract
 * repeatedly, and the `Commands:` block is the host stating its own
 * capabilities in its own words. It also degrades honestly — a helper that
 * gains `grok` starts being offered the moment it is installed, with no
 * version table to bump here.
 *
 * The shape it parses, from `tests/unit/fixtures/v0.4.44-agent-help.txt`:
 *
 *     Commands:
 *       claude    Launch `claude` in --dir with first-run prompts suppressed.
 *       codex     Launch `codex` in --dir with first-run prompts suppressed.
 *       opencode  Launch `opencode` in --dir with first-run prompts suppressed.
 *
 * Names sit at exactly two spaces of indent; click wraps a long description
 * onto continuation lines indented to the description column, so an indented
 * line that does not start a name is SKIPPED rather than treated as the end of
 * the block. A non-indented line is a new section and does end it.
 *
 * **null, never `[]`, when the answer is unknown** — a non-zero exit, no
 * `Commands:` header, or a header with nothing parseable under it. Callers act
 * on the difference: `[]` would be a host claiming it can launch nothing,
 * which no real helper says, whereas null means we never got an answer and the
 * caller should fall back to what the pinned version guarantees rather than to
 * refusing everything. See shared/agentLaunch.ts `HostAgentSupport`.
