  /**
   * Give a still-unplaced session the directory its NAME points at, once the

   * ## What this is for
   *
   * The tmux probe is the real answer and this never overrides it: a session
   * that reported its own working directory is returned untouched. This runs
   * only for the rows the probe could not place at all - and on the user's host
   * that was a third of them, four of twelve, every refresh, for a whole day.
   * See ../projects/sessionDirs.ts for the evidence about WHY the probe cannot
   * see them, which is that they are not on the tmux server it reaches.
   *
   * A session with no folder is not a cosmetic problem: the folder workspace
   * keys everything on the folder, so an unplaced session has nowhere to live
   * and the user cannot open it at all. That is why this is worth a host round
   * trip on the failure path.
   *
   * ## It confirms, it does not guess
   *
   * `git-dtc-website-import` is genuinely ambiguous between
   * `~/git/dtc-website-import` and `~/git/dtc-website/import`, and that
   * ambiguity is the documented reason `rootFromSessionName` refuses to derive
   * a directory from a name. It is resolved here by ASKING: every candidate
   * goes to the host in one batched `test -d`, and only a directory that
   * actually exists is ever adopted. The first surviving candidate wins.
   *
   * ## Rows that already have an INFERRED path are re-asked
   *
   * `inferPathsFromSiblings` files `git-red-stamp-sound` under
   * `git-red-stamp`'s directory because the names look like a suffix pair. That
   * is a reasonable guess and it is marked `pathInferred` precisely because it
   * might be wrong. If the host turns out to have `~/git/red-stamp-sound`, that
   * is the session's OWN directory and it beats the sibling's - so those rows
   * are asked about too, and a confirmed hit clears the `pathInferred` flag.
   *
   * ## Cost
   *
   * One exec, only when something is unplaced, and only for names not already
   * in the per-connection cache. A steady-state host with nothing unplaced
   * makes no call at all; a host with a permanently unrecoverable session pays
   * one exec on the first refresh and none afterwards, because the negative is
   * remembered - the same discipline, and the same trade, as the worktree cache
   * above.

   * discarded four rows" from "four rows arrived under a colliding name", and
   * the previous attempts each assumed one of those and fixed it.
   *
   * A bounded slice of the actual bytes settles it in one reading, and the BYTE
   * LENGTH beside it settles the one thing a slice cannot: whether the output
   * was truncated. `stderr` and the exit code come too, because a probe that
   * half-failed looks identical to one that found nothing.

   * Create a detached tmux session called [name] in [cwd].

   *
   * ## Idempotency
   *
   * Both the helper path (`sessions create` -> `tmuxctl create-detached`) and
   * the fallback (`tmux new-session -A -d`) are no-op successes when the named
   * session already exists. That is load-bearing for the folder-first flow:
   * the session name is derived from the folder, so "start a session here" for
   * a folder that already has one must re-open it, not fail and not create a
   * second one.
   *
   * ## One fallback layer, not the phone's two
   *
   * The Android gateway builds a POSIX-sh wrapper that probes `command -v
   * tmuxctl` and `tmuxctl create-detached --help`, exits a sentinel 97 when
   * either fails, and falls back to raw `tmux new-session` — because the phone
   * invokes **tmuxctl directly** and therefore owns that capability question.
   * The desktop goes through `pocketshell sessions create`, which IS the
   * helper's own wrapper around tmuxctl: it already resolves the memory cap
   * from the repo's `cgroups.toml`, and on a host with no cgroup support it
   * prints "tmuxctl: systemd-run unavailable; session runs without a memory
   * cap" to stderr and exits 0 (observed on the Docker fixture). So the
   * phone's layer 2 is handled server-side and its layer 1 is the helper's
   * business, not ours.
   *
   * What is left is the one case the helper cannot handle for us: `pocketshell`
   * is not installed on the host at all. That is detected by
   * {@link isHelperMissing} — and only then do we run the raw tmux create.
   * `via` in the result tells the caller which path ran, so the UI can say
   * "created without a memory cap" honestly.
   *
   * The predicate is deliberately narrow, and got narrower: it used to also
   * fire on Click's "No such command" / "No such option" (helper too old for
   * the subcommand), which is exactly the input this fallback must NOT accept.
   * Falling back trades the repo's `cgroups.toml` memory cap for no cap at all
   * and still reports `ok: true`, so a mistyped flag would have looked like a
   * successful create while quietly ignoring a budget the repo declared for
   * itself. Those exits now return `ok: false` with the host's line plus the
   * explanation from {@link annotateHelperRejection}.
