/**
 * Put back the sessions the helper's table omitted but the enrichment probe
 * SAW.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The table and the probe travel in the same round-trip but are independent
 * reads: the table is one CLI pass over every socket, the probe its own
 * sweep. On a loaded host the table can come back TRUNCATED — one socket's
 * rows missing while the probe saw them fine — and a table that merely
 * forgot a live session was being accepted as the whole truth, which pruned
 * the session's tab, closed its pane, and made a running session
 * un-openable until a luckier poll (measured on CI: tab bar held
 * `build` while the host sweep answered `main attached=1` and the
 * helper's own list named both).
 *
 * A session the probe saw is live — the same evidence the Stop locator
 * trusts — so the omission is repaired from the probe's rows. Timestamps
 * are the one thing the probe does not carry, so a restored row reports 0
 * for created/activity (it sorts last, it does not lie) and the next
 * complete poll replaces it wholesale.

/**
 * Reuse the last reported working directory for a session whose placement
 * evidence dropped out of THIS poll.
 *
 * A session's folder placement rests entirely on the enrichment probe: the
 * helper's table carries names and times but no paths. When that probe has a
 * bad round trip — measured flapping on CI (`tmux -u list-panes -a` exiting 1
 * while the session sat alive and attached on the host) — every path-bearing
 * row vanishes at once, and a session with no path has nowhere to live: its
 * folder's tab bar prunes it, its pane closes, and a running agent becomes
 * un-openable until a luckier poll. The cache is the answer the same problem
 * already got for repository roots: a directory a session was in does not
 * stop being true because one read of it failed.
 *
 * Pure: [cache] maps session name to last reported path and is UPDATED in
 * place (new evidence overwrites, absence never deletes). Returns the list
 * with nulls filled from the cache where one exists, flagged via
 * `pathInferred` so the UI can say the placement is remembered, not read.

/**
 * Give a session with no reported working directory the directory of the
 * session it is named after.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The user reported four sessions rendering as orphans - direct children of a
 * root with no folder - and circled two pairs they expected to sit together:
 * `git-red-stamp-sound` against `git-red-stamp`, and `git-dtc-website-import`
 * against `git-dtc-website`. In every pair the orphan's name is the other
 * session's name plus a `-suffix`, which is exactly what a second session in
 * one folder is called.
 *
 * It matters more than it used to. The folder workspace keys EVERYTHING on the
 * folder - one panel row per folder, one workspace per folder, tabs derived
 * from the sessions in it - so a session with no folder has nowhere to live at
 * all. Leaving it unplaced is not an annoyance any more; it is a live session
 * the user can no longer reach.
 *
 * ## Why it matches against siblings rather than deriving a path from the name
 *
 * `rootFromSessionName` (src/renderer/sessionGrouping.ts) recovers only the
 * ROOT from a name, and its comment explains the refusal to go further: `-` is
 * both the component separator AND a legal character inside a component, so
 * `git-dtc-website-import` is genuinely ambiguous between
 * `~/git/dtc-website-import` and `~/git/dtc-website/import`, and inventing a
 * folder from that guess is worse than having none.
 *
 * This does not guess. It only ever adopts a path that ANOTHER SESSION IS
 * ACTUALLY REPORTING, so it can file a session into a folder that exists and
 * can never conjure one that does not. The longest matching prefix wins, so a
 * host running both `git-a` and `git-a-b` places `git-a-b-c` under `git-a-b`.
 *
 * ## When it is wrong, and why it is still worth doing
 *
 * If `git-red-stamp-sound` genuinely runs in `~/git/red-stamp-sound` - its own
 * repo - this files it under `~/git/red-stamp`, and the real fix is the null
 * path rather than the grouping. The rows are marked `pathInferred` so the
 * guess is legible rather than silent, and {@link diagnoseSessionPaths} is what
 * settles which case a host is in. The alternative is leaving the session in
 * the bucket the user has just complained about.
 *
 * Sessions that already have a path are returned untouched, and a session with
 * no matching sibling keeps its null.

 * src/main/log.ts for why a file log exists at all). The point is to replace a

 *              tmux reports for a pane whose process has exited under
 *              `remain-on-exit`.
 *   ambiguous  a row exists under a different spelling, but the

 *              two sessions and dropped by 3ac7abc's safety rule.

/**
 * Why the two halves of this join can disagree about a session's NAME.
 *
 * The names come from `pocketshell sessions list`, which shells out to
 * `tmuxctl list`, which runs plain `tmux list-sessions`. The paths come from
 * our own probe, which runs `tmux -u list-panes -a`. Same host, same tmux
 * server, two different tmux CLIENTS — and a tmux client that has not been
 * told it is on a UTF-8 terminal SANITISES every byte it prints, replacing
 * each one outside ASCII with a single `_`. Captured on the fixture image
 * (tmux 3.4, sshd exporting no locale), for a session named `git-café-guide`:
 *
 *   $ tmux list-sessions -F '#{session_name}'
 *   git-caf_-guide
 *   $ tmux -u list-panes -a -F '#{session_name}::…'
 *   git-café-guide::…
 *
 * `-u` was added to the probe (issue #2160) so that PATHS survived exactly
 * this mangling. What it also did, unnoticed, was move one side of the join
 * key out of step with the other: the helper offers `git-caf_-guide`, the
 * probe is filed under `git-café-guide`, `Map.get` misses, and the session
 * keeps the `path: null` that `parseSessionsList` gave it. The row still
 * lists — it just has no working directory, so the Files tab opens at the
 * login home and the folder panel files it under `other`.
 *
 * Dropping `-u` would trade a broken name for a broken path and fix nothing.
 * Matching leniently costs one extra index and fixes both: look the exact
 * name up first, and only if that misses, look up the name with the same
 * sanitisation the un-`-u`'d client would have applied.
 *
 * Control bytes are folded too, because the same client applies the same
 * treatment to them — that is what breaks tmuxctl's own tab-delimited
 * `list-sessions` on this fixture (tmuxctl issue #6).
 *
 * The substitution is per DISPLAY COLUMN, not per byte and not per character,
 * which is worth stating because two of the three are wrong. Measured on the
 * same image:
 *
 *   git-café-guide  ->  git-caf_-guide     (1 char, 2 bytes, 1 column)
 *   git-ćé-x        ->  git-__-x           (2 chars, 4 bytes, 2 columns)
 *   git-日本-y       ->  git-____-y         (2 chars, 6 bytes, 4 columns)
 *
 * So a CJK or emoji character costs two underscores and a Latin accent one.
 * {@link displayColumns} models that; it does not have to be a complete
 * wcwidth, because a name this gets wrong simply fails to match and keeps
 * today's null path rather than acquiring a wrong one.
