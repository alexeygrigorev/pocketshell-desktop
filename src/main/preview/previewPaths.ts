/**
 * URL <-> remote-path arithmetic for the HTML preview, with no Electron and no
 * SFTP in it, so the part that decides "may this page read that file" can be
 * tested exhaustively as a pure function.
 *
 * ## Why any of this exists
 *
 * The Files tab previews a remote HTML document by serving it — and everything
 * it asks for — from a custom `psview:` scheme registered in main (see
 * HtmlPreviewService). That is what gives the frame a real base URL, so a
 * `<link href="style.css">` inside the page resolves by itself and comes back
 * to us as another request for another remote path.
 *
 * Which means the previewed document — bytes off an untrusted remote host —
 * gets to NAME PATHS THAT THE APP THEN READS OVER SFTP. That is a path
 * traversal boundary of exactly the kind LocalFileReader's header argues
 * about, and it is the reason the resolution below is written as a separate,
 * pure, over-tested module rather than three lines inside a request handler.
 * The rule it enforces is: every path a preview may read is inside ONE
 * directory, the one the previewed file itself lives in, after normalisation.
 *
 * ## Normalising ourselves rather than trusting the URL parser
 *
 * Chromium DOES fold `..` out of a standard-scheme URL before the request
 * reaches main, so by the time we see it `psview://tok/a/../../etc/passwd` has
 * usually already become `psview://tok/etc/passwd`. That is a convenience, not
 * a guarantee, and it is not the only encoding in play: a percent-encoded
 * `%2e%2e` is not a path segment to the URL parser but decodes to one, and a
 * caller inside main (a future feature, a test) may hand us a raw string that
 * never went near a browser at all. So the sequence here is always the same
 * and never shortcut: decode ONCE, then fold, then check containment.
 *
 * Decoding exactly once matters in both directions. Decoding zero times would
 * let `%2e%2e%2fetc` through as a literal filename that SFTP would then
 * interpret; decoding twice would make `%252e%252e` — which is the literal
 * two-character filename `%2e%2e` on the host — into a traversal. One pass is
 * what the URL spec says the path means, so one pass is what we do.
 *
 * Symlinks are NOT handled here, because they cannot be: a symlink is a fact
 * about the remote filesystem and this module knows only strings. The service
 * closes that hole by re-resolving each accepted path with `realpath` on the
 * host and running {@link containedIn} a SECOND time against the answer. Both
 * checks are needed — this one refuses a path that spells its way out, that
 * one refuses a path that walks out through a link.

 *
 * Climbing above `/` is refused rather than clamped to `/`. Clamping is what

 * request handler about which files are markdown, or the tab offers a Preview
 * tab for a file the handler then serves as plain text. So the two share one

 * question about a filename — which is precisely the cost this feature avoids
 * by converting in main. This module imports nothing at all, so the renderer
 * can share it for free, exactly as it already shares `mimeTypes.ts`.
 *
 * `.mdx` is deliberately absent for the reason `.jsp` and `.erb` are absent
 * from the HTML set: it is JSX embedded in markdown, so it is SOURCE for a page
 * rather than a page, and rendering it would show a document full of
 * unevaluated components. `.rst`, `.adoc` and `.org` are absent because they
