/**
 * "Serve this folder": the pure half.
 *
 * Command construction, port selection, URL building and failure
 * classification for the remote static file server. Everything in here is a
 * string in / string out so it can be tested without a host — see
 * `tests/unit/serveCommand.test.ts`. The stateful half (channels, forwards,
 * lifetime) is {@link ../portfwd/ServeService.ts}.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHICH SERVER, AND WHY IT IS THE STDLIB ONE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The feature was requested as "use the server in ~/git/ai-buildcamp" —
 * `~/git/ai-engineering-buildcamp/mdtohtml/http_server.py`, a 79-line ASGI app
 * run under `uv run --with 'uvicorn[standard]' uvicorn http_server:app`. We
 * deliberately do NOT use it, and we do not add a `pocketshell serve`
 * subcommand either. Reasons, in the order that decided it:
 *
 *  1. **It is not on the host.** That file lives in ONE repo on ONE machine.
 *     A Files-tab action has to work in any folder on any host the app can
 *     reach, so a server that ships with the interpreter beats a server that
 *     ships with a checkout. `python3 -m http.server` has been in the stdlib
 *     with `--bind` since 3.4 and `--directory` since 3.7; the probe below
 *     checks for it rather than assuming it.
 *
 *  2. **It needs `uv` and a network round trip.** `uv run --with
 *     'uvicorn[standard]'` resolves and downloads uvicorn on first use. That
 *     is a multi-second, network-dependent, failure-prone step in front of an
 *     action whose whole value is being instant.
 *
 *  3. **It is not actually better at the job.** For static files the stdlib
 *     handler is a superset: it serves directory INDEXES (the buildcamp app
 *     404s a directory with no `index.html`), falls back to `index.html` when
 *     one exists (same), guesses content types from the same `mimetypes`
 *     table (same), and streams the file with `shutil.copyfileobj` instead of
 *     `Path.read_bytes()`-ing the whole thing into memory (better — the Files
 *     tab is pointed at build outputs, which contain video and source maps).
 *
 *  4. **Its traversal guard is the weak spelling of the idiom.**
 *     `str(file_path).startswith(str(root))` also accepts `/rootabc` for a
 *     root of `/root`. `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.translate_path` normalises
 *     the URL path, drops `..` segments and `os.path.join`s the survivors onto
 *     the root, so there is no prefix comparison to get wrong. Since the thing
 *     being served is on the user's live box, the containment check is not a
 *     detail we want to own a copy of.
 *
 * A `pocketshell serve` subcommand — the shape the user actually asked for —
 * is the right long-term home and is written up in `docs/SERVE.md` as a
 * follow-up. It is not the thing to build first because the helper is a
 * SEPARATELY released Python project: hosts run 0.4.44 and this project
 * takes "hard cuts only, no shims", so the day this shipped against a
 * subcommand it would work on exactly zero hosts until every one of them
 * upgraded. The stdlib path ships today and costs nothing to retire later:
 * only {@link serveCommand} would change.

/**
 * THE bind address. Not a setting, not a parameter, not a default.
 *
 * `python3 -m http.server` binds **all interfaces** when `--bind` is omitted
 * ("default: all interfaces" in its own `--help`). The hosts this app talks to
 * are internet-facing dev boxes; the folders it is pointed at are whatever the
 * user right-clicked, which on a dev box means source trees, `.env` siblings,
 * build outputs and `~/git` in general. Omitting `--bind`, or letting it be
 * configurable, means one mis-click publishes a directory listing of the
 * user's home directory to the internet, with no auth, for as long as the app
 * is open — and, because nothing in the UI would look different, with no
 * indication that it had happened.
 *
 * 127.0.0.1 makes that impossible at the socket. The only route in is the SSH
 * connection the app already holds, which is authenticated, and the tunnel it
 * opens listens on 127.0.0.1 locally as well (`AutoForwarder.startPass`), so
 * the served bytes never touch a network interface at either end.
 *
 * If a future "share this on my LAN" feature is ever wanted, it must be a
 * separate, explicitly-named, explicitly-confirmed action — never a widening
 * of this constant.
