/**
 * "Serve this folder": run a static HTTP server on the host for a directory
 * the user right-clicked in the Files tab, tunnel it, and hand back a local
 * URL.
 *
 * Which server and why is argued in `serveCommand.ts`; the bind address and
 * what it protects against is argued at `SERVE_BIND_ADDRESS` there. This file
 * owns the three things that are not string manipulation: the channel the
 * server runs on, the forward that reaches it, and what happens to both when
 * something goes away.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE TUNNEL IS THE EXISTING ONE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Nothing here opens a socket. The server binds 127.0.0.1 on the host, the
 * port scan that `AutoForwarder` already runs every 5s sees it like any other
 * listener (the scan keys on the port, not the bind address), and we express
 * "forward this one" as the `force-on` INTENT the panel's own toggle uses. So:
 *
 *   - the served folder appears in the Ports panel as a row, with a name,
 *     byte counters and a status, because it IS an ordinary row;
 *   - it is stoppable from there, because rows are;
 *   - there is exactly one kind of tunnel in the app, and one place where
 *     local-port allocation, collision handling and reconnect live.
 *
 * The side effect is the documented one: forcing a port on lazily starts the
 * whole auto-forward engine for that host (`ForwardService.setIntent` ->
 * `ensure`), and that is persisted. Serving a folder therefore turns
 * auto-forwarding on. That is the app's existing contract for this action, not
 * something invented here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LIFETIME — THE PART THAT MATTERS ON SOMEONE ELSE'S PRODUCTION BOX
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The server is NOT detached. It runs on a PTY channel opened by
 * {@link SshService.openTrackedShell}, having `exec`'d the login shell away so
 * python is the session leader on that pty. Closing the channel is a hangup,
 * and a hangup on a pty kills its session — so every way this app can go away
 * kills the server with it, without any bookkeeping that could be wrong:
 *
 *   - the user presses Stop        -> `shellClose` ends the channel
 *   - the connection is dropped    -> `SshService.close` calls
 *                                     `ShellTracker.closeAllForConnection`
 *   - the transport dies under us  -> sshd tears the channel down its end
 *   - the app quits                -> `registry.clear()` ends every client
 *
 * `execBackground` + `setsid` + a pidfile was the alternative, and it is the
 * wrong trade here: it survives all four of those, so the failure mode becomes
 * an orphaned `http.server` still publishing a directory on a live box after
 * the app that started it is gone, recoverable only by a pidfile that is
 * itself a thing that can be wrong. Surviving a reconnect is not worth that;
 * re-serving is one right-click.
 *
 * The cost is honest and small: a dropped connection stops the server. The
 * panel says so (the record goes to `state: 'stopped'`) rather than leaving a
 * URL that quietly answers nothing.
