/**
 * A file log for the main process.
 *
 * The app is normally launched from a desktop shortcut, so nothing is attached
 * to stdout and `console.log` goes nowhere anyone can read. That matters most
 * for the paths DESIGNED to fail quietly: `TmuxClientPool` turns every switch
 * failure into an ordinary re-join, which is correct behaviour and completely
 * invisible — "it still isn't fast" is the only symptom, with no error anywhere
 * to say which branch ran.
 *
 * So the interesting decisions write a line here instead. Plain text,
 * append-only, one line per event, safe to read while the app is running.
 *
 * The path is derived from `os.homedir()` rather than Electron's
 * `app.getPath('userData')` on purpose. This module is imported by code that
 * unit tests exercise (`TmuxClientPool`), and those run outside Electron
 * entirely — a static `import { app } from 'electron'` would fail to resolve,
 * and the lazy `require` that avoids it is banned by this repo's lint rules.
 * A fixed, predictable location is also easier to ask a user to paste from.
 *
 * Deliberately synchronous. These are low-frequency decision points, and a
 * synchronous append cannot lose the last line to a crash or a quit — which is
 * exactly when the log is worth having.
