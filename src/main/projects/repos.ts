/**
 * `pocketshell repos list --json` parsing and failure classification.
 *
 * The unified schema is documented in the helper's own
 * `pocketshell/repos.py` module docstring (read off the Docker fixture,
 * helper 0.4.44) and confirmed against real `--local --json` output:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "owner": "alexeygrigorev" | null,
 *   "name": "pocketshell",
 *   "full_name": "alexeygrigorev/pocketshell" | null,
 *   "local":  {"path": "/home/…", "head": "main"} | null,
 *   "remote": {"default_branch": "main", "html_url": "…",
 *              "ssh_url": "…", "updated_at": "…"} | null
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `--local` rows always have `remote: null` and `--remote` rows always have
 * `local: null` — the helper deliberately does NOT join the two server-side,
 * so the merge lives here (same split as the Android `ReposRemoteSource`,
 * app/src/main/java/com/pocketshell/app/repos/ReposRemoteSource.kt:38).
 *
 * `owner`/`full_name` are null for a local clone whose origin is not GitHub
 * (or has no origin at all) — verified on the fixture, where a `git init`d
 * folder came back as `{"full_name": null, "owner": null, "name": "demo-repo"}`.
 * Any consumer that keys on `full_name` must therefore fall back to `name`.

/**
 * Is this exit the host telling us the `pocketshell` BINARY is absent, rather

 * One question only: did the shell fail to find the executable. 127 from
 * `/bin/sh` is "command not found", and the `gh` guard above it is needed
 * because the helper's own "`gh` is not installed" message also exits 127 —
 * see {@link classifyReposFailure}.
 *
 * ## What used to be here, and why it is gone
 *
 * This also returned true for Click's exit-2 `No such command` / `No such
 * option`, on the theory that a helper too old to have the subcommand is, to
 * us, as good as no helper. That was back-compat by intent and it is now
 * removed (no backwards-compat, hard cuts only): hosts run 0.4.44,
 * which has every subcommand and every option this app sends, so those exits
 * can no longer mean "old helper". They can only mean we built the invocation
 * wrong, or `pocketshell` on that host is not the helper we think it is.
 *
 * Keeping them here was actively unsafe rather than merely obsolete, because
 * this predicate is the trigger for the create fallback in
 * ../helper/PocketshellClient.ts (`createSession`): a true answer drops to a
 * raw `tmux new-session`, which creates the
 * session with NO memory cap and reports `ok`. A wrong flag on `sessions
 * create` would therefore have been laundered into a successful-looking create
 * that quietly ignored the repo's `cgroups.toml` budget. Those exits are now
 * explained by {@link describeHelperRejection} and surfaced as failures.
 *
 * Still deliberately narrow in the other direction too: a genuine runtime
 * failure of a command that DID run must be reported, never downgraded.

 *    `sessions resumable --json` was removed upstream while the docs still
 *    promised it.
 *
 * They were previously lumped together AND swallowed as `helper-missing`. They
 * are kept apart here because the fix differs — check the host's install vs.
 * fix the command we build — and the raw Click line names neither, so a user
 * reading "No such option: --cwd" in a dialog has nothing to act on. The host's
