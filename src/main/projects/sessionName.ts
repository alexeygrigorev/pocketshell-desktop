/**
 * Directory-derived tmux session naming.
 *
 * A faithful port of the Android app's
 * `app/src/main/java/com/pocketshell/app/projects/SessionNameDerivation.kt`
 * (`baseName` at :100, `sanitisePart` at :149, `resolveSessionName` at :74).
 * Both apps must name the same folder the same way, because the session name
 * IS the folder identity on the host — `tmuxctl` uses the same convention, so
 * a session created from the phone and one created from the desktop in
 * `~/git/pocketshell` are the same session, not two.
 *
 * ## Where the derivation actually lives now
 *
 * `sanitisePart` was moved to ../../shared/sessionNameParts.ts long ago,
 * because the renderer's redundancy test had to run the exact regex that
 * derived the name it was testing. `sessionBaseName`, `sanitiseName` and
 * `resolveSessionName` followed it there for the same reason, one level up:
 * the folder workspace labels its tabs by stripping a folder's derived base
 * name off its sessions (docs/WORKSPACE.md §3.3), so the renderer needs the
 * derivation itself and not merely the sanitiser. Two implementations of a
 * rule this exact would drift, and the symptom would be tab labels that
 * quietly stop stripping.
 *
 * They are re-exported here so every existing caller — and every existing
 * test — is unaffected by where the source sits. What remains genuinely
 * project-side is below: folder-name validation and path joining, neither of
 * which is a naming rule.
