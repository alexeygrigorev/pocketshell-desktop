/**
 * A POSIX-sh function, `__ps_taken`, that answers "does a session called `$1`
 * exist ANYWHERE on this host" — every tmux server the user has, not only the
 * default socket.
 *
 * ## Why the default socket is not the whole answer
 *
 * Because this host has already proved it is not. The evidence is committed in
 * ../projects/sessionDirs.ts and quoted from the user's own log: `pocketshell
 * sessions list` returned twelve sessions while raw `tmux` on the same
 * connection answered `can't find session: git-red-stamp-sound`,
 * `can't find session: git-dtc-website-import` and
 * `can't find session: git-ai-engineering-field-guide`. Three sessions the app
 * lists, shows a tab for, and attaches to, that a bare `tmux has-session`
 * denies the existence of.
 *
 * {@link freeSessionNameCommand} used to ask exactly that bare question, and a
 * "no" from it means "this name is free". So on this host the walk answered
 * `<base>` for a folder whose `<base>` session was open on screen — and since
 * `pocketshell sessions create` is attach-or-create, the "new" session was the
 * one the user was already looking at. That is the whole of the `+` -> New
 * session bug: a shell create appeared to do nothing because it re-selected the
 * tab that was already selected, and an agent create typed its launch line into
 * the terminal that was already in front of the user.
 *
 * ## Why sweeping the socket directory is the right remedy and not a guess
 *
 * It is the remedy this repo already reached for the same discrepancy, and for
 * the same reason. `SESSION_ENRICHMENT_COMMAND` (../helper/parsers.ts) runs the
 * default invocation first and then loops over `${TMUX_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/tmux-$(id
 * -u)/*` precisely because `list-panes -a` is per-SERVER and the user's host has
 * more than one. `has-session` is per-server in exactly the same way. Asking one
 * socket and calling the answer "the host" was the assumption; this removes it
 * rather than restating it.
 *
 * The default invocation stays FIRST and is not replaced by the sweep, for the
 * reason the enrichment probe gives: a host whose `TMUX_TMPDIR` points somewhere
 * this glob does not model would otherwise go from one answer to none. A stale
 * socket whose server has died prints `no server running` and exits 1, which
 * `2>/dev/null` and the loop's own continuation absorb.
 *
 * Note the direction this fails in. A socket we cannot read makes a taken name
 * look free, which is the bug above; a socket we can read can only ever make the
 * walk skip a suffix and hand back `<base>-3` where `<base>-2` was spare. The
 * first costs the user a session they asked for; the second costs a number.

/**
 * Rename tmux session [from] to [to].
 *
 * ## Why raw tmux and not the helper
 *

 * servers it knows. This is the same mechanism, aimed at a name instead of at
 * a client — with the one correction the per-session-server world forces: the
 * "same server the helper's sessions live on" is no longer always the default
 * one, so when the caller learned [from]'s socket the rename is aimed there,
 * exactly as the kill is. A null socket keeps the bare spelling.
 *
 * ## Why both `=` prefixes matter
 *
 * tmux's `-t` is a prefix-then-fnmatch match unless the target begins with `=`.
 * Without it, renaming `api` on a host that also runs `api-staging` would pick
 * whichever tmux resolved first — so the `=` is what makes "rename THIS
 * session" mean this session. `sessionExistsCommand` above carries the same
 * note for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Why `--`
 *
 * The new name is the one argument here that is not option-position-safe: a
 * name beginning with `-` would be read as a flag. `sanitisePart` strips
 * leading `-`, so this app cannot produce such a name — but this builder is the
 * injection boundary and it should not depend on a caller upstream having
 * sanitised correctly.

/**
 * Kill tmux session [name].
 *
 * **The only destructive command in this app.** There is no undo, and the thing
 * being destroyed is usually an agent in the middle of a task, so every clause
 * below was checked against the pinned Docker fixture rather than reasoned
 * about. The captures are committed beside this file's other evidence —
 * `tests/unit/fixtures/v0.4.44-*.txt` — the way 00eb3e7 captured
 * `pocketshell agent --help`.
 *
 * ## Why not the helper
 *
 * `pocketshell sessions` has **four** subcommands on 0.4.44 — `create`, `list`,
 * `resumable`, `resume` — and no kill verb at any spelling. `kill`, `stop`,
 * `rm`, `delete`, `destroy`, `remove`, `close` and `terminate` all come back
 * `Error: No such command` with exit 2
 * (`v0.4.44-sessions-help.txt`, `v0.4.44-sessions-no-such-command.stderr.txt`).
 *
 * ## Why not `tmuxctl kill`, which DOES exist
 *
 * `tmuxctl kill '<target>' --yes` is real, and `--yes` is not optional in
 * practice: without it `typer.confirm` prompts, and on the non-interactive
 * stdin an `exec` channel gives it that prompt aborts with exit 1 having killed
 * nothing (`v0.4.44-tmuxctl-kill-no-yes.stderr.txt`). It is rejected for two
 * measured defects rather than for taste:
 *
 *  1. **It cannot kill a numerically-named session.** `_resolve_session_target`
 *     branches on `target.isdigit()` and reads the name as an index into a
 *     recent list, so a session literally called `2` fails with
 *     `not enough values to unpack` and stays alive
 *     (`v0.4.44-tmuxctl-kill-numeric-name.stderr.txt`). This app can put such a
 *     tab on the bar — any session in the folder gets one — so a Stop that
 *     silently cannot stop THAT one is not acceptable for a destructive action.
 *  2. **Its own kill is not exact-match.** tmuxctl guards with
 *     `has-session -t "={name}"` and then kills with a BARE
 *     `["kill-session", "-t", session_name]`. The guard is exact and the kill is
 *     not, so between the two a neighbour can be hit.
 *
 * Raw tmux reaches the same server either way — `attachCommand.ts` records that
 * tmuxctl 0.4.x shells out to a bare `tmux` on the default socket, which is why
 * `sessionSwitchCommand` and {@link renameSessionCommand} are already raw.
 *
 * ## Why the `=` is the whole safety of this line
 *
 * tmux's `-t` is prefix-then-fnmatch unless the target begins with `=`, and the
 * dangerous case is NOT the obvious one. With `api` and `api-staging` both
 * alive, a bare `-t api` correctly kills `api` — exact match wins, so the bug
 * hides. The failure appears once `api` is already gone, which is exactly the
 * state a stale tab bar is in:
 *
 *   | alive                | command                        | outcome                        |
 *   |----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
 *   | `api`, `api-staging` | `kill-session -t '=api'`       | exit 0, `api-staging` survives |
 *   | `api-staging` only   | `kill-session -t api`          | **exit 0, kills `api-staging`**|
 *   | `api-staging` only   | `kill-session -t '=api'`       | exit 1, `can't find session`   |
 *
 * A bare `-t` fails OPEN: it destroys the wrong session and reports success.
 * `=` fails CLOSED, with a message the caller can show. For a command with no
 * undo that is the only acceptable direction to fail in.
 * (`v0.4.44-tmux-kill-session-exact-match.txt.`)
 *
 * ## The [socketPath] argument
 *
 * Aimed exactly as {@link sessionExistsCommand} aims its probe, for the same
 * per-session-server reason: the probe that located [name] also reported which
 * tmux server it lives on, and killing that name through a `-S` there is the
 * only spelling that can reach it. A null socket keeps the bare default form —
 * both the legacy hosts that have only one server and the callers that could
 * not learn a socket land here unchanged.

/**
 * Ask git, for each of [paths], which repository it belongs to
 *
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The user selected a folder called `merry-sniffing-token`, whose only session
 * is named `git-dtc-website-decisions`, and said: "this one should be in
 * dtc-website actually". That directory is a git WORKTREE of
 * `~/git/dtc-website`, and a worktree belongs with the repository it is a
 * worktree OF — which is also why the session carries that name, since it was
 * created against that repo. The name was telling us the answer all along and
 * the grouping was ignoring it in favour of the raw cwd.
 *
 * It is resolved by ASKING GIT rather than by parsing the name, because the
 * name cannot answer it: `-` is both the component separator and a legal
 * character inside a component, so `git-dtc-website-decisions` is ambiguous
 * between several paths (the same reason `rootFromSessionName` refuses to
 * invert past the first component).
 *
 * ## Why two queries per directory, not one
 *
 * `--git-common-dir` alone would over-reach. It answers "which repository is
 * this", so it maps a SUBDIRECTORY of a repo to the repo root too — meaning
 * sessions in `~/git/monorepo/pkg-a` and `~/git/monorepo/pkg-b` would collapse
 * into one folder. That is a much bigger behaviour change than the user asked
 * for and not obviously wanted.
 *
 * `--git-dir` is what makes the query precise. For a normal checkout — at the
 * root or anywhere below it — the two are EQUAL. Only in a linked worktree do
 * they differ: `--git-dir` is `<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>` while
 * `--git-common-dir` is `<main>/.git`. So emitting both lets the parser remap
 * worktrees and leave every other directory exactly where it is today.
 *
 * ## Why no `--path-format=absolute`
 *
 * That flag needs git 2.31+, and it turns out to be unnecessary. Both values
 * are resolved by `cd`-ing to them FROM the directory being asked about, which
 * handles the absolute and relative forms identically and costs nothing — so
 * there is no version gate, no fallback branch, and nothing to degrade.
 * `pwd -P` then resolves symlinks, so the two can be compared as strings.
 *
 * ## Why the host does the comparison, and prints an INDEX
 *
 * The output is `<index>::<commonDir>`, emitted ONLY for a directory that is a
 * worktree. Both halves of that are about parsing, and both were learned the
 * hard way (see ../projects/worktrees.ts): a directory path can contain the
 * `::` delimiter, and if it does then so do the two git answers, because they
 * are paths inside it. Printing all three fields is therefore unparseable in
 * principle, not merely awkward. Printing the request index — digits — plus a
 * single trailing path leaves exactly one ambiguous field, at the end, which a
 * split on the FIRST delimiter recovers whatever it contains.
 *
 * One exec for every directory, not one per directory: the same discipline the
 * session-enrichment probe and the port scanner already follow. A directory
 * that is not in a repository, or that git cannot read, prints nothing and is
 * simply absent from the result.
