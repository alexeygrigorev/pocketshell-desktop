/**
 * Monospace typography as a setting: which family, and at what size.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The surfaces that consume it are wildly different —
 * CSS custom properties for the app chrome, a CodeMirror theme that reads those
 * same properties, and xterm.js which reads NEITHER and has to be assigned to
 * in JavaScript — so the rules about what a legal font setting even is have to
 * live somewhere all three can share and none of them can quietly fork.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ONE FAMILY, TWO SIZES — and why that is not an inconsistency
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The FAMILY is a single setting for the whole app, because the app already
 * treats it as a single fact. `--font-mono` is not "the terminal's font": it is
 * the font of the terminal, the file editor, session names, ports, paths, IDs
 * and chips, and docs/DESIGN.md §2.3 says why in as many words — "use the same
 * face for the app's mono chrome … so the terminal and the UI that frames it
 * read as one surface". A per-surface family setting would let a user break
 * that on purpose, which is not a feature; it is the design being undone one
 * dropdown at a time. So the setting moves the token, and the token moves
 * everything downstream of it for free.
 *
 * The SIZE is two settings, because size is where the surfaces genuinely
 * differ:
 *
 *   - They ship at different values TODAY — 16px in the terminal
 *     (TERMINAL_OPTIONS.fontSize, mirrored by `--term-font-size`) and 13px in
 *     the editor (`--fs-300`, the app's workhorse). One shared size would have
 *     to pick one, and either choice silently resizes a surface on upgrade for
 *     every existing user. The brief was explicit that nothing may change size
 *     on upgrade, and that applies to the editor as much as to the terminal.
 *   - The terminal's size has a REMOTE consequence the editor's does not. Cell
 *     size decides the column and row count, which is pushed to the PTY, which
 *     makes tmux reflow on the far end. Bumping the editor two points reflows
 *     some text in a pane; bumping the terminal two points changes what the
 *     program on the other side of the wire believes about its screen. Those
 *     are not the same decision and it is right that they are two controls.
 *   - The app's UI type scale (`--fs-100`…`--fs-600`) is deliberately NOT
 *     included in either. It is a density system — 28px rows, 40px bars, the
 *     11/12/13/15/18/20 ladder of DESIGN.md §2.4 — and driving it from a font
 *     preference would rewrite every row height in the app. "Font size" here
 *     means the size of the text the user READS, not the scale of the chrome.

 * heuristic that misreports on metric-compatible faces). A curated list of
 * families that are common on this app's platforms, plus free text for
 * everything else, is the honest answer.
 *
 * Ordered by how likely they are to already be installed on the Windows target
 * this app is built for, then the cross-platform developer faces, then the

/**
 * Size bounds, shared by both size settings.
 *
 * The UI type scale tops out at 20px (DESIGN.md §2.4) and that is deliberately
 * NOT the cap here: the scale sizes chrome, and this sizes the text a user
 * stares at all day, which is a property of their eyes and their monitor rather
 * than of the design system. The bounds exist for the case the brief names —
 * a 4px or 400px terminal is not a preference, it is a mistake — and they are
 * the only thing standing between a hand-edited settings blob and an app with
 * one cell in it.
 *
 * 8 at the bottom: below that Consolas' hinting collapses under greyscale
 * antialiasing and tmux's status line stops being readable, which is the line
 * the user relies on to know which session they are in.
 * 32 at the top: past that a single cell is wider than a UI row is tall, and
 * the terminal stops being able to show a conventional 80 columns in any
 * window this app opens. (Consolas' advance is 0.5493em, so 80 columns needs
 * 80 x 0.5493 x size px — about 980px of pane at 22px, which is roughly what a
 * 1280px window has left once the session panel is open. Above ~22 the user is
 * trading columns for legibility, which is their call to make; 32 is where the
 * trade stops being a trade.)
