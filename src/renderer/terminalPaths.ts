/**
 * Finding file paths in a line of terminal output.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: no DOM, no Vue, no xterm, no SFTP. The only input is a
 * string that was already flattened out of the terminal buffer, and the only
 * output is a list of offsets into it. That is what makes the rules below
 * testable one false positive at a time (tests/unit/terminalPaths.test.ts),
 * and this module is nothing BUT rules.
 *
 * ## Why the rules are so suspicious
 *
 * Terminal output is not a document with a grammar; it is whatever the remote
 * program felt like printing. Underlining half a sentence because it contained
 * `and/or` does not read as a missing feature, it reads as a broken terminal —
 * so every rule here is biased towards saying no. A path that is not linkified
 * costs the user a copy-paste. A word that is wrongly linkified costs the
 * terminal its credibility on every line it prints.
 *
 * The consequence is that some real paths are deliberately NOT matched:
 *
 *   - anything with a space in it (`/tmp/my file.mp3`), because a space is the
 *     only token boundary a terminal reliably gives us and guessing where the
 *     path ends would produce a link that opens the wrong thing;
 *   - a bare name with no slash (`preview-1.mp3`, `Makefile`), because every
 *     English word ending in `.py` in prose would become a link;
 *   - a single-slash relative path with no extension (`src/main`), because
 *     `and/or`, `client/server`, `read/write`, `w/o`, `y/N` and `n/a` are the
 *     same shape and appear far more often in real output.
 *
 * ## What a match is
 *
 * `start`/`end` are offsets into the scanned line rather than a substring,
 * because xterm's link provider wants cell POSITIONS: it has to map the match
 * back onto buffer coordinates to know which cells to underline. `path` is the
 * path alone — the surrounding quotes, brackets, sentence punctuation and any
 * `:12:5` position suffix have already been peeled off it, while `start`/`end`
 * still span the suffix so the whole of `src/main.ts:12` underlines as one
 * link the way an editor shows it.
