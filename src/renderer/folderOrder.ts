/**
 * The session panel's MANUAL folder order (docs/SESSIONLIST.md §14).
 *
 * > "let's not rearrange workspaces/sessions in here because it's confusing.
 * > let's use wheveer order we had when creating. but I can also pull them up
 * > and down to rearraange"
 *
 * Two halves, and they are deliberately in two files. The first half — stop
 * moving on your own, use creation order — is a fact about the host and lives
 * in `sessionGrouping.ts` with the rest of the projection. The second half —
 * the arrangement the user reached by dragging rows until the panel looked
 * right — is a preference about the panel, and it lives here.
 *
 * ## This is `shared/workspaceTabs.ts`'s manual-order section, one level up
 *
 * The workspace's tab bar already solved exactly this problem
 *, and the shape is reused rather than reinvented:
 * `applyFolderOrder` is `applyTabOrder`, `canDropFolderAt` is `canDropTabAt`,
 * `reorderFolders` is `reorderTabs`. Everything §15 argues for holds here for
 * the same reasons, so the arguments are cited rather than restated — except
 * the two places where the panel genuinely differs, which are written out in
 * full below (the group rule, and what happens to a key that leaves the list).
 *
 * ## The stored value is a RANKING, not a list of folders
 *
 * §15.2 is the load-bearing part and it applies here with MORE force, not less.
 * A tab set changes when a session is created or killed; the panel's folder set
 * changes for those reasons AND because the panel re-reads the host every five
 * seconds (SessionTree's `POLL_MS`), on a list that spans every root on the
 * box. So the stored value has to be a preference ABOUT folders rather than a
 * list OF them — as a list it would need reconciling on every tick, and every
 * reconciliation is a chance to invent a row or lose one.
 *
 * As a ranking, the three awkward cases need no handling at all:
 *
 *   - **a NEW folder** — the user just started a session somewhere new — has no
 *     rank, sorts after everything that has one, and lands at the bottom of its
 *     root. That is where creation order would have put it anyway, so a folder
 *     the user has never arranged behaves identically whether or not they have
 *     arranged anything else;
 *   - **a REMOVED folder** — its last session was killed — is simply absent from
 *     the roots and leaves no hole, because nothing is positioned by index;
 *   - **an UNKNOWN key** — a folder that is gone, or one belonging to a host
 *     this order was not written for — ranks nothing and is inert.
 *
 * The sort is STABLE and the comparator only ever compares ranks, so two
 * unranked folders keep their creation order relative to each other.
 * `Array.prototype.sort` has been required to be stable since ES2019.

 * than a box has ever had sessions in. They are guards on a hand-editable JSON
 * blob, in the same spirit as `SESSION_ROOTS_MAX` — so a corrupt or
 * pathological settings file cannot make the panel build a ranking map with a

 * because it is the one with no salvageable meaning. Inside it, damage costs
 * one ENTRY — a host whose value is not an array of strings loses its
 * arrangement and nobody else's, and a stray non-string inside one host's array
 * costs that key alone.
 *
 * Duplicates are dropped rather than tolerated. A repeated key would give one
 * folder two ranks, and `Map` would silently keep the last — so the file would
 * mean something subtly different from what it reads as. Keeping the FIRST
 * occurrence is the reading that matches the list's own semantics: it is
 * ordered best-first, so the first mention is the one the user placed.

/**
 * Re-sort each root's folder rows by a stored manual [order], keeping creation
 * order for anything the user has not placed.
 *
 * ## The ROOTS themselves are never reordered, and a row never leaves its root
 *
 * This is the panel's version of §15.1's group rule, and it is the one place
 * the two features reach a different answer for a different reason. The tab
 * bar's groups (sessions / files) are a presentational grouping, so keeping
 * them separate is a judgement call that §15.1 admits is "cheap to relax". A
 * root is not presentational: it is a real directory on the host, or a root the
 * user registered in Settings, and a folder row sits under it because its
 * working directory is genuinely inside it (`bestRootForPath` /`rootForPath`).
 * A row dragged from `git` into `tmp` would be a claim about where the folder
 * LIVES, and the row's own tooltip — which prints `dir.path` — would contradict
 * its position on screen the moment the user hovered it. There is nothing to
 * relax here; the constraint is the filesystem's, not this module's.
 *
 * So the ranking is applied WITHIN each root and never across them, and the
 * root sequence is left exactly as `groupSessionsIntoRoots` produced it
 * (registered order, or oldest-created first, with `other` pinned last). That
 * also means a stored order can hold keys from every root in one flat list
 * without any of them being able to move a row between roots: two keys in
 * different roots are simply never compared.
 *
 * A NEW array is returned and the input is not mutated, because the input is a
 * Vue computed's value: sorting `root.directories` in place would be a write
 * during a read, which is how a reactive dependency loop starts.

 *

 * what refuses a cross-root drag, and it refuses it without either side having
 * to know which root the drag started in: the panel calls this with the root
 * the pointer is currently over, and a key from a different root is simply not
 * in it. A key naming no live row at all — a stale drag, a hand-crafted event —

/**
 * Move [fromKey] to gap [toIndex] within its own root, and return the WHOLE
 * PANEL's folder keys as the new stored order — or null when the move is
 * refused or is a no-op.
 *
 * ## Why the whole panel and not the one root
 *
 * §15's reason first: a total ranking is what makes `applyFolderOrder`'s
 * "unranked sorts last" mean "folders I have never touched go at the bottom".
 * If only the moved row were ranked, every other row would be unranked and the
 * one drag would have moved everything.
 *
 * And one the tab bar does not have: the panel is many roots at once, so a
 * write scoped to one root would have to be merged into whatever was stored for
 * the others. Emitting the flat list in DRAW ORDER — root by root, folders
 * inside each, which is exactly `folderTree.ts`'s `folders` — makes the merge
 * unnecessary, because the emitted list already contains every other root's
 * current arrangement. One write, no reconciliation.
 *
 * ## A key that is not on screen right now is dropped
 *
 * The flat list holds the rows the panel is drawing, so a folder whose sessions
 * were all killed loses its rank the next time anything is dragged. That is
 * deliberate and it costs nothing: an unranked folder sorts to the BOTTOM of
 * its root, and a folder that has been away since the last arrangement would
 * have been ranked after every currently-visible row anyway. Retaining stale
 * keys would buy the same position at the price of a list that only ever grows.
 * (The tab bar reaches the same place from the other side, by pruning against
 * the live bar — `pruneTabIds`, §15.2.)
 *
 * ## The index is clamped, not rejected
 *
 * §15's reason exactly: the interaction being performed is "put this as far up
 * as it goes", and refusing an overshoot outright would make the first and last
 * positions reachable only by a pixel-accurate drop. {@link canDropFolderAt} is
 * what stops an overshoot being invited; this is what makes it harmless.
 *
 * Returning null for a no-op is what lets the caller skip writing — and
 * persisting — an arrangement for a drag that ended where it started, which is
 * most cancelled drags.
