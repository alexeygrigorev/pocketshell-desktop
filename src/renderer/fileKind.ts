/**
 * What kind of thing is behind a filename, decided BEFORE its bytes are read.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The Files tab used to have no type gating whatsoever: every click ran
 * `sftp:readFile`, which decodes the whole file as UTF-8 and binds the result
 * to a textarea. Clicking an mp3 therefore decoded several megabytes of
 * binary into replacement characters and asked the renderer to lay them out
 * as one enormous line of text — which is not a slow render, it is a hang.
 * A PDF did the same, and so would a 200 MB log, which is text but is still
 * more of it than a textarea can lay out.
 *
 * So the classifier's real job is a NEGATIVE one: guarantee that nothing but
 * decodable text ever reaches the editor. Everything else routes to a viewer
 * that understands bytes (audio, PDF, image) or to an honest panel that says
 * what the file is and offers to download it. There is deliberately no path
 * from "I could not render this" back to the text editor — a wall of mojibake
 * is a worse answer than a sentence saying the file is binary.
 *
 * ## Two stages, because a filename is a hint and bytes are evidence
 *
 * {@link classifyByName} is the cheap stage and runs first, off the SFTP
 * listing alone. It is enough for the common cases and it is what lets an
 * oversized file be refused without transferring it.
 *
 * {@link classifyBytes} is the second stage, for the extensions the first
 * cannot place — no extension at all (`README`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`), or
 * one nobody tabulates. Those get their bytes fetched under the text ceiling
 * and inspected: a magic number first, then a printability sniff. A file with
 * a weird extension that really is text still opens in the editor; a file with
 * a weird extension that is really a zip does not.
 *
 * The mime strings come from src/main/attachments/mimeTypes.ts rather than a
 * table of our own — see the note there about why there is exactly one.
