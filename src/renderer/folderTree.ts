/**
 * The session panel's tree, derived once and read by everything that needs it.
 *
 * `SessionTree.vue` computed this privately, and that was fine while it was the
 * only reader. It is not any more: `Ctrl+↑` / `Ctrl+↓` move to the previous or
 * next FOLDER WORKSPACE, and the chord is owned by `HostWorkspaceView` because
 * that is where the route lives — so two components now need the same list, in
 * the same order, keyed the same way.
 *
 * Deriving it twice would be the exact failure this codebase has already paid
 * for once. `$HOME` decides whether a folder is keyed `~/git/foo` or
 * `/home/me/git/foo`, and two spellings of one key is a panel row that opens a
 * workspace with no tabs in it — the bug `sessionGrouping`'s `rootHostPath`
 * exists to prevent on the other side of the same conversion. A chord that
 * navigated by a key the panel spells differently would put the user in an
 * empty workspace and highlight no row, which reads as the folder having
 * vanished.
 *
 * So the derivation moves HERE, and both call sites read it. Everything in it
 * is the code that used to sit in `SessionTree`, unchanged in behaviour: the
 * store reads are the same, the `$HOME` fallback is the same, and
 * `groupSessionsIntoRoots` is the same pure function it always was.
 *
 * ## The user's manual arrangement is applied HERE, for the same reason
 *
 * A dragged folder row (docs/SESSIONLIST.md §14) changes the order the panel
 * draws, and `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓` must walk the order the panel draws — the chord
 * exists to move between the rows the user can see, and a chord that skipped a
 * row or visited them in a second order would be a different feature wearing
 * the same keys. So the ranking is applied in this file, on top of the
 * projection and below both readers, exactly as `$HOME` is: one derivation, two
 * consumers, no chance of disagreement.
