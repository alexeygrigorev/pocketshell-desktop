// Settings: the app-level preferences screen.
//
// WHERE THIS LIVES, AND WHY IT IS AN OVERLAY
//
// Ports and Usage are overlays because they are HOST-level and belong to the
// workspace header. Settings are app-level, so on the face of it they belong
// somewhere else entirely — a route. They are still an overlay, for two
// reasons that both come out of this app's structure rather than out of taste:
//
//   - A route would unmount the workspace. `/settings` as a top-level route
//     replaces HostWorkspaceView, which owns the terminal; leaving the screen
//     to flip a switch would tear down xterm and take the user's scrollback
//     with it. That is a real cost the Ports overlay was already avoiding.
//   - It has to be reachable with no connection. `defaultHost` is a decision
//     about STARTUP, so the host picker is precisely where a user goes looking
//     for it. An overlay is the only host-agnostic surface this app has: the
//     same component, opened from the picker's header and from the workspace's,
//     over whatever is behind it.
//
// So: one view, mounted inside `OverlayPanel` by two callers. It renders no
// heading of its own — the overlay chrome owns the title (see UsageView's
// `embedded` prop and the duplicated-heading note in OverlayPanel).

 * whose briefing assumed the opposite and was wrong: Ctrl+Tab is a plain tab at

 * part of why the cycle chords were released back to the shell.

      TWO SIZE CONTROLS, AND WHY EACH ONE CARRIES ITS OWN PREVIEW.

      These shipped as "Terminal size" and "File editor size" under one
      heading, with a single shared sample between them, and a user reported
      twice that "font size has no effect" — because they were moving the
      editor's control while watching the terminal. The wiring was correct
      both times. That is a labelling defect, not a user error: two adjacent
      numeric fields whose only distinguishing mark was a word in a hint
      nobody reads.

      Both settings are kept. They are genuinely two decisions — the terminal's
      size changes the cell, so it changes the rows and columns pushed to the
      PTY and tmux reflows on the far end, which the editor's size cannot do —
      and merging them would jump every existing user's editor from 13px to
      16px on upgrade, breaking the rule the whole typography feature was built
      on. What changes instead is that each control now names its surface in
      the LABEL rather than in prose, and each is followed by a captioned live
      sample rendered in that surface's own face, size and ground. A preview
      that visibly moves when you touch the control is self-explanatory in a
      way no label is; if this is still confused after that, the answer is to
      merge them and accept the editor jump.

      Keyboard.

      Grouped by SURFACE rather than alphabetically or by frequency, because
      the question a reader has is never "what does Ctrl+L do" — it is "I am
      looking at the Files tab, what can I press". The blurb under each heading
      says when that group is live, which is the part no code comment could
      ever have told them.

      Every chord is a run of <kbd> chips, one per key. Not a glyph: this is
      exactly the screen where a ⌘ or an ↑ would be pressed into service as an
      icon, and tests/unit/designGates.test.ts
      — enforces that every glyph doing an icon's job here is a real SVG. So the arrows
      are the words "Up" and "Down", which also happen to be what a keycap says.

        What PocketShell refuses to take, and why.

        This is not a disclaimer. Two of the three reasons are things a user

        Ctrl+C and you cannot stop a running program; bind one to Ctrl+W and
        the window closes as well as running the command, because that
        accelerator belongs to Electron's own menu and the page cannot take it
