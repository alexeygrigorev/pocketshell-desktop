// FolderWorkspaceView: everything scoped to ONE project FOLDER, rendered in
// the host workspace's right pane. It replaces SessionWorkspaceView, which was
// scoped to one session.
//
// The tab bar is the whole idea:
//
//   [ main ] [ import ] [ Terminal 2 ] [ Files ] [+]
//
// one tab per tmux session in the folder, then one or more Files tabs, session
// tabs first. A session tab IS a terminal — there is no sub-navigation inside
// one, because the Conversation view that used to compete for that space has
// been deleted.
//
// Four structural notes, three of them inherited from the view this replaces
// because the reasons have not changed:
//
//   - ONE TerminalView PER SESSION TAB the user has visited, all of them left
//     mounted, only the active one shown. Main keeps a tmux client per session
//     and holds it for the life of the tab (src/main/ssh/TmuxClientPool.ts), so
//     each pane already holds its own session's screen and moving between tabs
//     is a `v-show` and nothing else — no SSH, no redraw, no bytes.
//
//     This is the reverse of what this file said until now, and the reason is
//     measured. One re-pointed TerminalView meant every tab click cost a
//     `tmux switch-client` exec plus a full-screen repaint over SSH: p50 210 ms
//     on the user's host when it worked, and it mostly did not, falling back to
//     a ~2 s re-join. A switch cannot be made to feel like changing tabs in an
//     editor, because an editor does not ask another machine for the tab.
//
//     Panes are mounted LAZILY — a tab gets its TerminalView the first time it
//     is selected, never before. Mounting one while hidden would have xterm's
//     FitAddon measure a 0x0 box and push its 2x1 minimum at the remote.
//   - The terminals stay mounted (`v-show`, not `v-if`) while a Files tab is
//     showing; unmounting one would close its SSH shell and drop the attach.
//   - Identity and tabs share ONE bar, for the 40px of window it gives back to
//     the pane.
//   - `.workspace-body` is the composer's stage: the card floats over the tab
//     content inside it rather than docking below, so no composer state can
//     change the terminal's row count.
//
// The composer is mounted ONCE, outside `.tab-body` and never behind a `v-if`,
// so a tab switch cannot cost a draft. It follows the ACTIVE SESSION TAB — its
// per-session record is keyed on the session name, so switching session tabs
// swaps the draft and switching back restores it.

 * exactly one reader — this component — and no action anywhere else in the app
 * needs to read or write it. A store would buy nothing but a file, and the
 * thing that genuinely IS shared (each Files tab's browsing position) already
 * lives in the files store, keyed by the tab id this map hands out.
 *
 * Keyed by the HOST ALIAS and the folder, so one host's tabs cannot appear on
 * another — and so an entry outlives a reconnect, which a connection-id key
 * cannot do: a re-dial mints a fresh connection id, but it is the same host
 * and the same tmux sessions, so the workspace should come back as it was. The
 * alias is also what the persisted copy in ../workspaceState keys on, which is
 * why a relaunch can find this map's contents on disk at all. It is never
 * pruned: an entry is two small strings, and the alternative is a teardown
 * hook that has to guess when a workspace will not be revisited.
 *
 * The record's shape — what a Files tab carries, why the MRU is a stack — is
 * documented with `WorkspaceMemoryRecord` in ../workspaceState, which is the
 * same shape at a longer lifetime: `persist()` writes the map entry to
 * localStorage verbatim, and `remembered()` seeds a missing entry from it.

/**
 * `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]` to step one tab left or right.
 *
 * ## Why this is a WINDOW listener and not the terminal's key handler
 *
 * The chord has to work with focus in the terminal, the Files tree or the
 * composer, and those are three different keyboard owners: xterm consults its
 * own custom handler, CodeMirror runs a keymap, and the composer's textarea is
 * an ordinary field. Routing the chord through each of them would be three
 * implementations of one gesture — and the third one added later would be the
 * one that forgot to `preventDefault`.
 *
 * A `keydown` in CAPTURE on `window` runs before ANY of them, whatever holds
 * focus, because capture descends from the window to the target. So there is
 * one handler and it cannot be reached around. It is the same shape the
 * composer's own `Ctrl+\`` uses (PromptComposer's `onGlobalKey`), deliberately.
 *
 * ## `preventDefault` AND `stopPropagation`, and why both are load-bearing
 *
 * `stopPropagation` is what stops the event ever reaching xterm's textarea, so
 * xterm never gets to encode it. `preventDefault` is what stops CHROMIUM acting
 * on it — Electron still has a browser underneath. Leaving either off is the
 * defect that has now landed three times in this app (bc86cf7's doubled first
 * letter, 3628090's doubled paste, and the Ctrl+V route after them): one
 * keystroke, two paths.
 *
 * ## The terminal is NOT a safe place to let this fall through
 *
 * The brief's premise was that a tab chord is affordable "because terminals
 * cannot encode it". Measured against the xterm this app ships (@xterm/xterm 6,
 * `evaluateKeyboardEvent`), that is not true for THIS chord either, which is why
 * TerminalView also declines it: **`Ctrl+[` is C0.ESC (`0x1B`)** — THE physical
 * escape of older keyboards and readline's meta-prefix — **and `Ctrl+]` is
 * C0.GS**. That is a real cost, in vim sessions most of all, and it is stated
 * rather than assumed; meta sequences remain reachable through Alt.
 *
 * ## What went, and what came back with it
 *
 * `Ctrl+1`..`Ctrl+9` (jump to the Nth tab), `Ctrl+Shift+PageUp`/`PageDown`
 * (move the active tab) and the CYCLE — `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` — were
 * removed at the user's request: "remove ctrl 1 2 3 hotkey", "Move the active
 * tab left or right remove this too", "remove these hotkeys let's keep only
 * ctrl left and ctrl right".
 *
 * Removing them GIVES KEYS BACK to the pane, which is the part worth writing
 * down: `Ctrl+3`..`Ctrl+8` are the C0 controls `ESC`, `FS`, `GS`, `RS`, `US`
 * and `DEL` (`Ctrl+3` is a widely used stand-in for Escape);
 * `Ctrl+Shift+PageUp`/`PageDown` reach xterm's own scrollback; and `Ctrl+Tab`
 * is C0.HT — completion at a shell prompt, since xterm ignores Ctrl on Tab —
 * while `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` is ESC [ Z, back-tab. All of them were being
 * swallowed for chords that no longer exist, so the declines in TerminalView
 * went with them (`nextWorkspaceTabId` went with the cycle).
 *
 * Moving a tab from the keyboard went with the chord. The drag
 * is unaffected and is still the way to reorder.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not touch
 *
 * Anything with Alt or Meta. `Ctrl+Alt` is how AltGr arrives on European
 * layouts, where `[` and `]` carry printable characters on several of them —
 * the same reason TerminalView's Ctrl+V branch demands `!e.altKey`. And a
 * rename in progress owns the keyboard: the field is a one-word edit with
 * Enter/Escape of its own, and stepping out of it would leave an orphaned edit
 * on a tab the user can no longer see.

/**
 * Create a session here, and launch [choice] in it once its PTY exists.
 *
 * [choice] is null for a plain shell. It arrives already validated — the
 * dialog will not let a broken one be confirmed — but it is re-checked here
 * anyway, because this is the last point at which nothing has been created
 * yet. That ordering is the fix for the old flow's worst property: it created
 * a session and only then found out the command was malformed, so a failed
 * launch still cost the user a stray session and an error to read in a
 * terminal.
 *
 * ## Every exit from here is either a new tab or a sentence
 *
 * There used to be a third kind, and it was the whole of the reported bug. The
 * host can answer a `unique` start with the name of a session this bar is
 * ALREADY showing — see ProjectsService.startSession for the socket-blindness
 * that made it do so — and this function trusted the name it was handed. Both
 * symptoms fell out of that one line:
 *
 *  - a shell create assigned `selected` the tab that was already selected, so
 *    the dialog closed and nothing else visibly happened at all;
 *  - an agent create armed the launch against a session whose PTY was already
 *    up and registered, so the watcher below fired on the spot and typed
 *    `pocketshell agent …` into the terminal the user was working in.
 *
 * The second is the serious one: it is this app writing a command into a live
 * session nobody pointed it at. So the name is checked against the bar BEFORE
 * anything is armed or selected, and the launch is armed LAST — after the
 * refresh, after the tab is known to exist, and with no `await` between the
 * selection and the arming, so no PTY can register in the gap and fire the
 * watcher against a session this function has not vouched for.
 *
 * A refusal is always a sentence in `createError`, which renders directly under
 * the tab strip. "Nothing happened" is not an outcome this function is allowed
 * to have.

    <!-- ONE row of chrome, and now only one thing in it: the tabs and the `+`.

         The folder's NAME and a `×` that deselected it used to trail here. The
         user circled that end of the strip and said "no need for this part",
         and they are right on both counts.

         The name was the same fact three times over. The selected folder is
         already the highlighted row in the session panel beside this, and the
         window title already carries the host — so a label here named a thing
         the eye had just come from. This app has removed that redundancy twice
         before: from session rows in b841362, and from the merged identity
         header in 38bf971, whose reasoning ("one fact twice") is the same
         reasoning as this. An earlier request to expand the leaf into a full
         `~/git/red-stamp` path is superseded rather than reversed: it was an
         attempt to make this element earn its space, and the user has since
         decided it does not have any to earn.

         The `×` deselected the folder and returned the right pane to its
         placeholder. No way out is lost with it: the session panel is
         persistent, so another folder row switches workspace directly, and the
         panel's own back arrow leaves the host. What is no longer reachable is
         the placeholder state ITSELF once a folder has been picked — a pane
         that says "select a folder" while a folder is selected, which is not a

                 A FILES tab's `×` closes the view and nothing else (§12), and
                 every one of them has it — the first included. The old rule
                 spared the first tab because closing it would leave the

                 clicked in the terminal with none standing opens its own (the
                 reveal watcher below).

                 A SESSION tab's `×` is the context menu's Stop, one click
                 closer. It opens the SAME named, confirmed dialog the menu
                 does rather than killing on the click, because §14's argument
                 survives the affordance: the thing behind the tab is a live
                 process on another machine, and the control that can destroy
                 it must say so and ask. The tooltip says Stop, never Close —

         tree go with it.

/* ---- the composer floats over the tab content --------------------------- */

 * Why an overlay and not a docked row: docked, the composer was a flex sibling
 * of the tab body, so every open, close and resize changed the terminal's pixel
 * height — which changes its ROW COUNT, which is an SSH window-change the
 * remote tmux has to redraw and reflow for. Typing a prompt should not reflow
 * the session behind it.
 *
 * Why the dock is the WHOLE body and not a strip at the bottom: because the
 * card MOVES. Every clamp in src/shared/composerGeometry.ts is measured against
 * this element.
