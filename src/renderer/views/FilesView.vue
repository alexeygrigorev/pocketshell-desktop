 * The file tree used to be CONTENT-sized — `min-width: 260px` over an `auto`
 * flex basis — so it grew to the longest filename in whatever directory was
 * open and shrank again on the way back out. Browsing therefore moved the
 * editor beside it on nearly every click, which is what the user objected to.
 *
 * It is a definite basis now, and drag-resizable, because a fixed width that is
 * wrong for your filenames is a different complaint of the same shape. The
 * mechanism is the session panel's, deliberately: same clamp, same
 * clamp-on-READ as well as on write, same one-write-per-drag. See
 * HostWorkspaceView.vue, which explains why the read is clamped too — a stored
 * value can predate a change to the clamp, and a hand-edited or corrupt entry
 * must not be able to strand the pane.
 *
 * ## Why localStorage and not the settings store
 *
 * Because it is a pixel width of a pane in this window, which is what the
 * session panel's width is, and that one lives in localStorage. The settings
 * store is for preferences the user sets in the Settings overlay and reasons
 * about by name; a number you arrive at by dragging until it looks right is not
 * one of those.
 *
 * ## Why it is shared by every Files tab, not stored per tab
 *
 * A Files TAB remembers its own DIRECTORY, because where you are browsing is a
 * fact about that tab. How wide the pane is, is a fact about how you like to
 * look at files — and per-tab widths would mean the pane jumping as you moved
 * between two Files tabs, which is the original complaint wearing a hat. It is
 * app-level for the same reason the composer's geometry is (stores/composer.ts:

 *
 *   - unsaved edits, which the preview does not show at all (it renders the

 *   - scripts, which never run — a page that builds itself at runtime is a

 *   - resources on remote origins, which are refused so that rendering a
 *     page cannot tell a third party which file on which host is being
 *     inspected. This one is derived from the SOURCE rather than counted,
 *     and it has to be: the refusal happens inside this renderer, under the
 *     frame's own CSP, so the request never reaches main and main can never
 *     report it. Without the line, a page whose images all live on a CDN
 *     would say "0 blocked" beside a grid of broken-image icons;
 *   - assets refused for being outside the page's own folder, which is the
 *     one real limit of the scoping in HtmlPreviewService and the one a user
 *     can act on (open the page from its project root instead);
 *   - assets that were asked for and are not there, which is usually the
 *     page's own bug and is worth distinguishing from ours;
 *   - the budget cap, which means the render is knowingly partial.
 *
 * The counts come from main and arrive asynchronously as the frame loads, so

             document lands on an opaque origin (so it is cross-origin to this
             app and cannot touch its DOM), no script runs, no form submits, no
             popup opens, and nothing may navigate the top-level page. Adding a
             single token — `allow-scripts` above all — would hand a remote
             host arbitrary execution inside the renderer process that holds
             this app's SSH sessions. The reasoning, and what a scripted
             preview would cost and buy, is written out in full at
             src/main/preview/HtmlPreviewService.ts.

             The document is ALSO governed by a strict Content-Security-Policy
             delivered as a real header on every psview: response, because a
             CSP is not inherited across this kind of frame navigation. Two
             independent mechanisms, neither relying on the other.

             MEASURED in the built app rather than assumed, the way the PDF
             embed and the Monaco CSP question were settled. Loading the
             fixture page in the packaged renderer and probing from inside the
             frame:

               window.api                 -> undefined  (no preload in subframes)
               window.parent.document     -> SecurityError
               window.top.location.href   -> SecurityError
               inline <script>            -> "Blocked script execution … the
                                             document's frame is sandboxed and
                                             the 'allow-scripts' permission is
                                             not set"
               <img src="https://…">      -> refused by img-src
               location.origin            -> "psview://<token>"

             That last one is worth writing down because it is NOT the "null"
             a fully sandboxed frame is usually described as having: on this
             Electron, a document on a registered standard scheme keeps a
             serialised origin even under an empty sandbox. It changes
             nothing that matters — the three probes above are the actual
             isolation and all three hold — and it has one pleasant
             consequence: the token sits in the URL's HOST position, so two
             open previews are on different origins from each other as well as
             from the app.

             `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` is belt-and-braces: with no network
             permitted there is nothing to send a referrer to, but if that ever
             changes, the previewed page's own path — which names a directory
             on the user's server — should not be the thing that leaks first. -->
