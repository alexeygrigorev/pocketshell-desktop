// Host picker: reads ~/.ssh/config, lists hosts, and connects on click.
// After a successful connect it navigates to the host workspace, where the
// session tree + terminal live.
//
// It is also the launch screen, so it owns the auto-connect to the user's
// default host. The rules for that decision are in ../autoConnect.ts; what
// lives here is only the dialling and the escape hatches, which are the part
// that matters:
//
//   - THE PICKER IS NEVER REPLACED BY A SPINNER. The host list stays on screen
//     for the whole attempt, with a banner above it. There is no state in which
//     the user is looking at a screen with nothing to press.
//   - CANCEL IS ALWAYS VISIBLE while dialling — for ANY dial, clicked or
//     automatic. A clicked dial hangs exactly as long as an automatic one (the
//     30s backstop below is one layer down from both), and every row is
//     disabled while one is out, so a picker without this strip is a picker
//     with nothing to press for half a minute. Pressing it abandons the
//     attempt immediately from the user's point of view, and hangs up on the
//     connection if it lands afterwards, so a cancelled dial cannot leave a
//     live link the user no longer wants.
//   - NO EXTRA RENDERER-SIDE TIMEOUT. `SshService.connect` already caps the
//     dial at DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS (30s) and resolves — never rejects — with a
//     real diagnostic. A second timer here would race it and would usually win,
//     replacing "All configured authentication methods failed" with a useless
//     "timed out". A bounded backstop plus an instant manual escape is what
//     "escapable" needs, and the bound already exists one layer down.
//   - A FAILED AUTO-CONNECT LEAVES THE DEFAULT ALONE. The error is shown on the
//     picker; the setting stays set, because a host being down is not a reason
//     to forget which host the user wants.
