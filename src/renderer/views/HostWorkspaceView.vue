// Host workspace: the shell for a connected host.
//
// Layout: a persistent left panel holding the folder-grouped session list,
// and a right pane showing the selected FOLDER's workspace. The panel never
// goes away — picking a folder only swaps what the right pane renders:
//
//   /host/:name                -> SessionPlaceholderView (nothing selected)
//   /host/:name/folder/:folder -> FolderWorkspaceView (a tab per session, then Files)
//
// There is deliberately NO host topbar. The row that used to sit here —
// back, collapse, `hetzner · alexey@135.181.114.209`, Ports/Usage/Settings,
// disconnect — spent a full --topbar-h above every terminal mostly on an
// identity label, in an app whose whole point is the terminal. It went four
// ways (docs/DESIGN.md §5.3b):
//
//   - the IDENTITY is the OS window title now (the `win:setTitle` watch
//     below) — the native title bar was already there, saying "PocketShell";
//   - BACK and COLLAPSE moved into the session panel's own header row, which
//     was already paying for its --topbar-h;
//   - PORTS / USAGE / SETTINGS were a panel-FOOT row, and now sit as controls
//     in that same header (docs/DESIGN.md §5.3c→e) — the user asked for them
//     at the top, and since §5.3e each of Ports and Usage is its OWN icon
//     there rather than a row of an overflow menu. The overlays did not move;
//     only their triggers did;
//   - DISCONNECT moved to the host picker's row for the connected host —
//     every disconnect already navigated there, so the button now lives at
//     its own destination, next to where the connection was opened.
//
// Folders are the default view of a host, and tabs belong to the selected
// FOLDER. The two host-scoped panels — port forwarding and
// provider usage — open as overlays, because neither is a property of one
// folder.

/* ── `Ctrl+↑` / `Ctrl+↓`: the workspace above, the workspace below ─────────
 *
 * Asked for as one gesture with the tab chords — "up and down - different
 * workspaces", "left and right - tabs within workspace" — and that pairing is
 * the whole design. The two axes are the two lists on screen: the tab bar runs
 * across the top of the workspace, the folder rows run down the panel on the
 * left, and each arrow moves along the thing that lies in its own direction.
 * Nobody has to remember which is which, because the keyboard mirrors the
 * layout.
 *
 * ## Why HERE and not in the workspace
 *
 * `FolderWorkspaceView` owns the horizontal pair, because tabs are its own
 * state. The vertical pair changes WHICH workspace is mounted, so it belongs to
 * the thing that owns the route — and this is it (`onSelectFolder`). Putting it
 * in the workspace would mean a component navigating away from itself, and the
 * one case that has to work would be the one it could not serve: an empty
 * panel, or a route with no folder yet, where no workspace is mounted to listen.
 *
 * ## Which rows, and in what order
 *
 * `useFolderTree().folders` — the SAME derivation the panel draws from, in the
 * same order, keyed the same way. Deriving the list a second time here is the
 * one thing this must not do: `$HOME` decides whether a folder is keyed
 * `~/git/foo` or `/home/me/git/foo`, and a chord navigating by a key the panel
 * spells differently lands in a workspace with no tabs and highlights no row.
 * See the header of `folderTree.ts`.
 *
 * The list is FLAT across roots, so `Ctrl+↓` on the last folder of `git` opens
 * the first folder under the next root. The user is stepping down the PANEL,
 * and a root header is a label, not a stop.
 *
 * It CLAMPS at both ends (`adjacentIndex`), same as the tab arrows: an arrow
 * is a direction, and being thrown from the top of the panel to the bottom is
 * not what "up" asked for.
 *
 * ## What it costs, and where it stands down
 *
 * `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓` at a shell is `ESC [ 1 ; 5 A` / `ESC [ 1 ; 5 B`, which
 * readline leaves unbound by default — so this is the cheaper half of the two
 * pairs. In a real text field it does nothing at all here: the same
 * `editingTarget` rule the tab arrows follow, kept in step deliberately, or one
 * axis of a single gesture would behave differently from the other in a draft.
 *
 * `capture: true` on `window` for the reason FolderWorkspaceView's handler
 * documents at length: xterm, CodeMirror and the composer are three different
 * keyboard owners, and capture runs before all of them. `preventDefault` and
 * `stopPropagation` both, so neither Chromium nor xterm also acts on it.
