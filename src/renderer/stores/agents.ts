 * §9): the user asked for conversations to be dropped completely, so the tab,
 * the transcript resolver, the `agent-log` client and the IPC behind them were
 * removed rather than left as an unused path (docs/ANALYSIS.md D22).
 *
 * `loading` survived that cut and is worth a note, because it is the one thing
 * the removal could have broken silently. It was written ONLY by the
 * conversation loader, but it is READ by the usage refresh button in
 * UsageView.vue and HostWorkspaceView.vue — so deleting the writer would have
 * left a spinner that never spins and a button that is never disabled, with
 * nothing to say why. `loadUsage` owns it now.
