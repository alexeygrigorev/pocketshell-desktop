/**
 * Files store: the SFTP browser state for the active connection. Holds the
 * current directory listing + the open file, which may be text in an editor
 * buffer, or bytes behind an object URL for the viewers.
 *
 * ## What the open file is, now that it is not always text
 *
 * `openFile` used to be one line: read the path as UTF-8 and bind it to a
 * textarea. That is what froze the app on an mp3 — several megabytes decoded
 * to U+FFFD and handed to a textarea as a single line. So an open file now
 * carries a KIND, decided before any bytes move (src/renderer/fileKind.ts),
 * and the kind decides which of three terminal states it lands in:
 *
 *   text            -> `openContent`, editable, savable
 *   image/audio/pdf -> `openUrl`, an object URL over a Blob with a real mime
 *   html/markdown   -> BOTH: `openContent` for the editor and `previewUrl`
 *                      for a sandboxed frame, with `docView` saying which
 *                      one is on screen
 *   binary          -> `openNote`, a sentence and a download button
 *
 * There is no arm that falls back from one of the others to text. Every
 * failure — oversize, unreadable, a mime we could not name — ends in the
 * binary state with a reason, because a wall of mojibake is a worse answer
 * than a sentence saying what the file is.
 *
 * ## Per-session browsing position
 *
 * The Files tab is behind a `v-if` in the workspace, so leaving it unmounts
 * the view. `clear()` used to run on that unmount, which threw away the
 * directory the user had navigated to: going to Terminal and back dropped
 * them at the session's start directory every time. The remembered position
 * below fixes that WITHOUT weakening what `clear()` was for — one
 * connection's listing must never leak into another's — by keying the memory
 * on the connection as well as the session, and by clearing on DISCONNECT
 * rather than on unmount.

 * Turn a possibly-tilde-prefixed path into one an SFTP channel can resolve.

 * (helper/parsers.ts says so explicitly, and canonicalisation there
 * deliberately never expands it). SFTP has no shell to do the expanding, so
 * `realpath("~/git")` looks for a DIRECTORY NAMED `~` and fails.
 *
 * No home lookup is needed to fix it: an SFTP session's relative root is the
 * login home — that is why `realpath(".")` is how the home is found in the
 * first place — so dropping the `~/` leaves a relative path that resolves to
 * exactly the same place, in the same single round trip.
 *
 * Only a leading `~` that refers to OUR home is handled. `~other/x` is left
 * alone: it means another user's home, which relative resolution would get
 * wrong, and failing honestly beats opening the wrong directory.

/**
 * Turn a path someone did not browse to — printed by a program, or typed into
 * the path bar — into one this connection's SFTP channel can resolve.
 *
 * The output is either absolute or relative-to-the-login-home, which are the
 * two things `sftp.realPath` understands — an SFTP session's relative root IS
 * the login home, which is the same fact {@link stripTilde} is built on and
 * the reason no home lookup is needed anywhere in here.
 *
 * THREE anchorings, and the first two ignore [base] completely:
 *
 *   - absolute (`/tmp/olya-v3tts.mp3`) is already complete. It is returned
 *     untouched — never joined to anything, which is the bug this shape of
 *     function is famous for (`/home/alexey/git/foo//tmp/olya-v3tts.mp3`);
 *   - `~/x` is anchored on the login home, so it goes through `stripTilde`
 *     and lands relative to the SFTP root, which is that same home;
 *   - anything else is relative, and only then does [base] matter.
 *
 * What [base] is depends on who is asking, and it is the caller's job to know:
 * a path in a session's output is relative to where that SESSION runs
 * (`SessionSummary.path`), while a path typed into the Files tab is relative
 * to the directory being BROWSED. Either can itself be a literal, unexpanded
 * `~/git/foo` (helper/parsers.ts says so of session paths), which is why the
 * base goes through `stripTilde` rather than being used as it came.
 *
 * `..` and `.` inside the path are left for the remote `realpath` to fold:
 * doing it here would mean guessing about symlinks the host knows about and we
 * do not.

 * of a shell arrives quoted (`'/tmp/my file.mp3'`) because that is how the
 * shell needed it written; a path copied out of a log or a chat arrives with
 * whitespace around it. Neither is a typo worth an error message.
 *
 * Returns null for an empty field, which is "do nothing" rather than an error:
 * pressing Enter on a blank path bar should dismiss it, not complain.
 *
 * A SPACE INSIDE THE PATH IS FINE HERE, and that is a deliberate difference
 * from the terminal-output detector, which refuses any candidate containing one
 * (see terminalPaths.ts). The refusal there is about ambiguity: a space in a
 * line of output could be the end of the path or a character in it, and there
 * is no way to know. In a path bar there is no ambiguity at all — the whole
 * field is the path, the user said so by typing it there — so `/tmp/my
 * file.mp3` is accepted exactly as written.
