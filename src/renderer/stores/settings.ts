/**
 * App-level preferences — the settings screen's model.
 *
 * "App-level" is the whole point of this store existing separately. The
 * composer store already persists preferences, but they are preferences ABOUT
 * THE COMPOSER, written by the composer as a side effect of using it (where
 * the card sits, whether it is open). What lives here is the other kind: things
 * the user goes somewhere to *decide*, which no feature writes on its own, and
 * which a feature elsewhere then obeys. Keeping those in the feature stores is
 * how preferences ended up scattered across `pocketshell.composer.*` and a bare
 * `pocketshell.sessionPanelWidth` key inside a view — three storage schemes for
 * one idea.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW TO ADD A SETTING — three lines, one place each, and nothing else.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. Add the field to {@link AppSettings}. That is the type the whole app
 *      sees; `toRefs` below means the store exposes it automatically, so
 *      `useSettingsStore().myNewKey` starts working with no other change.
 *   2. Add one entry to {@link SETTING_SPECS} — its default and its parser.
 *      The parser is what makes a hand-edited or half-written blob survivable:
 *      a value that fails it falls back to that key's default and the REST OF
 *      THE BLOB IS STILL HONOURED. Never write a parser that trusts the stored
 *      type; it is user-writable JSON on disk, not a value we produced. If the
 *      value is a collection, degrade per ENTRY too — see `asRootList` — and
 *      note that a reference-typed default is copied on the way out
 *      ({@link applyDefault}) so instances are never shared.
 *   3. Render a control for it in `views/SettingsView.vue`.
 * There is no fourth step: persistence, restore and validation are generic over
 * the specs, so nothing here needs touching per key.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY localStorage AND NOT electron-store
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `electron-store` is already a dependency and is already used in main
 * (src/main/portfwd/PortfwdStore.ts), so it was the obvious candidate. It is
 * the wrong tool here for two reasons:
 *
 *   - It lives in the MAIN process. The renderer is sandboxed
 *     (contextIsolation, no node integration), so reaching it means a new pair
 *     of IPC channels and an inherently ASYNC read. Settings are read during
 *     the first render — `defaultHost` decides whether the host picker even
 *     appears — so an async read means either an await before mount or a frame
 *     of wrong UI. localStorage is synchronous and available at store
 *     construction, which is exactly the shape this data needs.
 *   - The composer store already established the convention for renderer-owned
 *     preferences (a versioned key, a tolerant loader, a silent failure path).
 *     A second mechanism for the same class of data would leave the app with
 *     two answers to "where are preferences?", which is the problem this store
 *     is meant to end.
 *
 * The rule that falls out: preferences the RENDERER owns live here; anything
 * main must read at boot (window bounds, forward rules) stays in electron-store
 * where main can reach it without a renderer being alive.
 */

 * Every app-level preference, in one shape.

   * PER HOST, keyed on the `~/.ssh/config` alias — unlike `sessionRoots`, which

   * an arrangement is a statement about the folders that are actually THERE,
   * and no two hosts have the same ones. The alias rather than the connection
   * id for the reason the tab order gives (§15.3): a connection id is an opaque
   * handle minted per connect, so an order keyed on it would be a fresh key
   * every launch and would never survive a restart.
   *
   * It lives in this store rather than in `localStorage`, which is where the
   * tab order went. §15.3's rule — "the settings store is for preferences a
   * user sets BY NAME in the Settings overlay" — points the other way, and it
   * is overruled here because the two cases differ in scope: a tab order
   * belongs to ONE folder of ONE host and is written by the workspace that owns
   * it, whereas this is a per-host map the panel has to read before any
   * workspace is mounted, and this store is already the thing that loads a
