/**
 * Projects store — the folder-first session-creation flow.
 *
 * A session is not named, it is *placed*: the user picks a project folder by
 * one of three routes (an existing folder, a new empty folder, a fresh GitHub
 * clone) and the session name is DERIVED from that folder by the host, never
 * typed. This store owns the data-fetching half of that flow;
 * `NewSessionDialog.vue` owns the form state.
 *
 * Two deliberate shapes here, both inherited from the backend contract:
 *
 *  - **Folder browsing goes through SFTP.** There is no folder-listing channel
 *    and there should not be one: `projects.home()` supplies the root and
 *    `sftp.list()` filtered to `type === 'dir'` supplies the children, which is
 *    the same wrapper the Files tab already uses.
 *  - **Nothing here throws.** Every `projects.*` call resolves a result object
 *    with an `ok` flag, so the failures that matter (a folder that vanished, a
 *    host with no `gh`) arrive as data the UI can react to rather than as an
 *    exception it can only print.
