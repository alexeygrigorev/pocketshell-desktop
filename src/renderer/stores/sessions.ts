   * it is "the user asked for this and is waiting" — it spins the panel's
   * Refresh glyph and disables the button. A poll that set it would spin that
   * glyph for a fraction of a second every few seconds forever, which reads as
   * the panel permanently working rather than as it quietly keeping up.
   *
   * `error` is deliberately NOT quietened, and that is the half that matters
   * for correctness. A poll that fails leaves the previous list in place —
   * there is nothing better to show, and blanking the panel on one bad round
   * trip would be worse than showing a list that is a few seconds old — so the
   * only thing standing between the user and a stale tree is this message. A
   * folder row that should have vanished and did not is exactly the state that
   * has to come with a reason attached.
