/**
 * Prompt-composer state: one record per session, plus ONE app-level visibility.
 *
 * The Android original keeps a SINGLE activity-scoped ViewModel shared by every
 * session on a host (PromptComposerViewModel.kt:813-820), which is why it needs
 * the #746 "owner stamp" that DISCARDS a draft when you switch sessions. That
 * mechanism is deliberately NOT ported (docs/COMPOSER.md §12.4): a keyed map
 * satisfies the same user-visible invariant — a draft never appears in a session
 * it was not authored in — while being strictly better, because switching away
 * and back restores your prompt instead of destroying it.
 *
 * The split between what is keyed and what is not is the whole design here:
 *
 *   per session   draft, staged attachments, caret, the error banner,
 *                 in-flight flags. These are FACTS ABOUT A SESSION — your
 *                 half-written prompt for `build` has no business showing up
 *                 in `main`.
 *   app level     open / closed / maximized, and the card's GEOMETRY. Those are
 *                 PREFERENCES ABOUT THE TOOL. Keying the mode per session meant
 *                 a session you had never opened the composer on started from
 *                 `blankState()` — open — so closing the panel and switching
 *                 sessions brought it straight back, which is what the user
 *                 reported.
 *
 * The card's size and position sit on the app-level side for the same reason,
 * and the height moved there with them (it used to be per session). Where the
 * composer sits on screen describes your WINDOW LAYOUT, not any conversation:
 * a per-session position would make the card jump around as you switch
 * sessions, which is precisely the bug just fixed for open/closed. The pane is
 * shared by every session too, so a placement that is legal for one is legal
 * for all.
 *
 * Every action below maps one-for-one onto a Kotlin method so the port stays
 * auditable; the citations are in the doc comments.

/**
 * A staging batch in flight.
 *
 * We cannot un-send an IPC call that is already on the wire, so a batch is
 * MARKED and its result dropped when it lands. One cancel reason is left:
 * 'discard' — the user hit Discard (:783-800). This is cancellation, NOT the
 * #570 partial-failure path: a result that arrives normally always keeps its
 * survivors, even when `ok` is false.
 *
 * ## 'send' is gone, and `done` is what replaced it
 *
 * There used to be a second reason: hitting Send mid-upload abandoned the batch
 * and sent the prompt with whatever was already staged. This code cited the
 * phone for it (`:684-688`) and the user — who wrote the phone app — says that
 * is not what the phone does: "that's not how the phone app works. it waits".
 * Their report of the desktop behaviour is what a dropped batch feels like from
 * the outside: "If I'm uploading an image and hit enter, I wait till image is
 * uploaded and then send the prompt" — the image simply was not in the prompt.
 *
 * Abandoning it was the worse rule on its own merits, whatever the phone does.
 * The user attached an image and then wrote a prompt ABOUT that image; sending
 * the words without the picture does not deliver a smaller version of what they
 * asked for, it delivers a question with its subject missing — to an agent that
 * will answer it anyway, having never seen the image.
 *
 * So the batch now carries a promise that settles when staging is finished, and
 * `send` awaits it. It settles on EVERY exit — success, partial failure, the
 * upload timeout, a thrown IPC — because a send parked on a promise that never
 * resolves is a composer that has silently stopped working.
