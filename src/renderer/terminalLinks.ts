/**
 * The xterm side of "click a path in the terminal, land on it in the Files tab".
 *
 * Three jobs, in order:
 *   1. flatten a buffer line (with its wrapped continuation rows) back into a
 *      string, remembering which cell produced each character;
 *   2. run the pure detector over that string (./terminalPaths.ts);
 *   3. hand xterm an ILink per match, whose `activate` asks the files store to
 *      reveal the path.
 *
 * Step 1 is the only part that is not obvious. xterm has no "give me the
 * logical line" call: a line longer than the window is stored as several rows,
 * each flagged `isWrapped`, and a link's range is expressed in CELLS. So the
 * flattening keeps a parallel array of cell positions — one entry per UTF-16
 * code unit of the string — and the match offsets are mapped back through it.
 * Walking the cells (rather than using `translateToString` and doing
 * arithmetic) is what keeps the mapping right when a row contains a double-width
 * character, which occupies two cells but one string index.
 *
 * ## Why `isWrapped` is not enough, in THIS pane
 *
 * `isWrapped` is set when xterm itself ran out of columns — the writer kept
 * printing past the right margin and the terminal moved to the next row. That
 * is not how anything writes to this pane. The pane is always a tmux client and
 * tmux redraws row by row (`tty_cursor(tty, 0, y)` before each one), and the
 * agent TUIs inside it are full-screen renderers that position every cell they
 * paint. Neither ever lets a line overflow, so a line the USER sees broken
 * across two rows arrives here as two rows with `isWrapped` false on both — and
 * a path that spans the break is never seen whole by the detector.
 *
 * Five user reports are the shapes the rules below reconstruct:
 *
 *   - the Codex TUI wrapped mid-token and continued at column 0 of the next
 *     row, i.e. exactly the hard wrap xterm would have flagged had it done the
 *     wrapping (rule 1);
 *   - the Codex TUI wrapped its own block and prefixed the continuation with
 *     its box-drawing gutter (`  │ `), which has to be dropped as well as
 *     joined (rule 2);
 *   - this app's own CLI wraps long tokens at the hyphens inside them instead
 *     of at the margin, so the row above the break ends a few columns SHORT of
 *     full — `…/event-webinar-` / `og.png` — and rule 1b reads the hyphen as
 *     the break opportunity it is;
 *   - a markdown-rendering CLI fills the row up to the last `/` inside the
 *     token instead of to the margin — `…vectorize-agent/` / `diagrams` —
 *     which is the same shape with the slash as the opportunity, so rule 1b
 *     takes both characters;
 *   - the same CLI also breaks tokens when the row is nowhere near the pane's
 *     margin — `…work-chronicle-` / `overview.png` sat a dozen columns short
 *     in a wider window — because tmux keeps rows painted at the width they
 *     were RENDERED at, and the window has since been resized. No fixed
 *     "how far short of the margin" bound survives that; rule 1b's fit
 *     arithmetic therefore runs against the render width inferred from the
 *     fullest nearby row ({@link inferWrapWidth}), never against the pane's
 *     live width.
 *
 * Both rules are deliberately narrow, for the reason terminalPaths.ts's header
 * gives: joining two rows that were never one line can only invent a path that
 * does not exist, and an underline stretched across a boundary is the most
 * visible way this feature can look broken. Each condition is spelled out at
 * the rule.
 *
 * ## Appearance
 *
 * A path link is decorated exactly like the http links this terminal already
 * has: pointer cursor and an underline, both on hover only — the decoration
 * vocabulary xterm's link provider API offers. The underline inherits the
 * cell's own foreground, so a path printed green underlines green and the
 * terminal keeps saying what the program said.
 *
 * Hover is not the layer the user judges by, though. The remote CLI colours
 * and underlines its file references itself, and when ITS wrapper breaks a
 * path across rows the underline covers only the first row's fragment — so
 * at rest a path read as highlighted halfway no matter how well the join
 * worked. Persistent highlighting therefore exists as its own layer:
 * terminalPathHighlights.ts blocks the whole joined path in the theme's
 * selection tint, re-derived from the buffer for every row the renderer
 * touches — the rescan is what answers the marker-staleness objection that
 * once kept this hover-only. The tint is the theme's own selection colour
 * solidified over the terminal ground (themes.ts terminalLinkTint): no new
 * palette values, per docs/DESIGN.md §3.
 *
 * ## Clicking while the remote app owns the mouse
 *
 * This pane is ALWAYS a tmux client, and the agent TUIs it runs turn mouse
 * reporting on, so "does a link still fire when the remote program is grabbing
 * clicks?" decides whether any of this works in practice rather than only in a
 * bare shell. It does fire, and the reason is that the two mechanisms are bound
 * to different elements (xterm 6.0.0, verified against its sources):
 *
 *   - mouse REPORTING binds to `.xterm` — `CoreBrowserTerminal.bindMouse()`
 *     opens with `const el = this.element`;
 *   - the LINKIFIER binds to `.xterm-screen`, a child of it —
 *     `createInstance(Linkifier, this.screenElement)`.
 *
 * A click lands inside the screen, so the linkifier's own mousedown/mouseup run
 * first on the way up, and `Linkifier._handleMouseUp` calls `link.activate`
 * with no consultation of `areMouseEventsActive` anywhere along that path. The
 * outer handler's `cancel(ev)` calls `stopPropagation`, which only stops the
 * event travelling FURTHER up — it cannot un-run a listener on a descendant.
 * The decorations survive too: `.xterm.enable-mouse-events { cursor: default }`
 * is overridden by the later and equally specific `.xterm .xterm-cursor-pointer`
 * in xterm's own stylesheet.
 *
 * What the user ALSO used to get was the same click delivered to the remote
 * program, so tmux could move its cursor or select the pane under the pointer
 * on the way. That side effect is gone for plain clicks:
 * terminalMouseSelection.ts replaces `SelectionService.shouldForceSelection`,
 * the predicate `bindMouse`'s mousedown handler consults before `sendEvent`,
 * so a plain button-1 press is never reported and follows the link cleanly.
 * SHIFT is the deliberate hand-off: a Shift-click is reported to tmux and
 * still follows the link, because the linkifier's listener on the descendant
 * runs regardless.

 *
 * "Block" is the contiguous run of non-blank rows around the hover, and the
