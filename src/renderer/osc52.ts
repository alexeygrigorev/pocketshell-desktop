/**
 * The receive side of OSC 52 — "set the clipboard" — for the terminal pane.
 *
 * ## Why the pane wants this
 *
 * The pane is a tmux client and the agent TUIs inside it turn mouse reporting
 * on, so a plain drag selects IN TMUX (see terminalLinks.ts, "Clicking while
 * the remote app owns the mouse"): tmux paints the highlight, and releasing
 * the mouse runs its copy-and-cancel — the highlight vanishes, which reads as
 * "my selection disappeared" even though the yank succeeded. The text's way
 * out of the remote box is the escape sequence tmux offers the outer terminal
 * (`set-clipboard` defaults to `external`): `ESC ] 52 ; Pc ; Pt BEL`, with Pt
 * the yanked text as base64. Nothing here answered that sequence, so a
 * drag-release landed nowhere the user could paste from. This decoder is the
 * answer: TerminalView registers it as an OSC 52 handler and writes what it
 * returns to the system clipboard, making drag-then-release an actual copy.
 *
 * The same sequence is how ANY remote program (an agent among them) may set
 * the local clipboard. That is the feature and also the risk surface, so the
 * decoder is deliberately narrow: a payload this function refuses is a yank
 * that never happened, not a corrupt one.
 */

/**
 * Cap on the base64 payload, before decoding. Clipboard-shaped text is far
 * below this; the cap exists so a runaway sequence — an agent echoing a
 * megabyte of base64, a broken program looping — cannot balloon the user's
 * clipboard. ~0.75 MiB of decoded text is generous for a yank.
 */

/**
 * Decode the data xterm hands the OSC 52 handler — everything between the
 * `52;` identifier and the string terminator, i.e. `Pc ; Pt`.
 *
 * Returns the decoded text, or null when the sequence must not touch the
 * clipboard: malformed, an unknown clipboard selector, over the cap, or an
 * explicit "clear the clipboard" request (empty Pt) — a remote should not be
 * able to blank what the user had there.
