// HostPanelButtons: the two host overlays as DIRECT icon buttons, rendered
// identically from the session panel's header and from the collapsed rail.
//
// §5.3e killed the overflow menu at the user's ask ("we can kill the kebab here
// and have two icons instead"). What makes that affordable — what answers
// ca79ae2's "two unlabelled glyphs are a memory test" without reopening it as
// an argument — is that each button keeps its WORD in one place a tooltip is
// enough for: the `title`, which is also its whole accessible name. The same
// held for the retired `⋯` trigger ("Ports, Usage") and holds now per button.
//
// It is a component rather than two `<button>`s written twice because it has
// exactly two call sites that must not drift, which is the reason
// HostActionsMenu existed; this replaces it with the smallest shape that
// preserves that property. Items come from HOST_PANEL_ITEMS (../hostPanels.ts)
// rather than written out, so the triggers and the workspace's own `panel` ref
// keep sharing one vocabulary.
//
// The Ports button additionally carries the auto-forward indicator: a tinted
// ring + a small dot while the engine is running for this host (§16 of
// docs/PORTFWD.md), and — once ports are actually live — the dot becomes a
// count pill, so the button answers "on, and how many" without the overlay.
// The workspace owns both values and hands them down so the two surfaces stay
// identical; the state has to live THERE because the forwards store is only
// fresh while the ports overlay is open.
