/**
 * DoodleCanvas: draw a quick illustration, or annotate an image, and attach
 * the result to the prompt as a PNG.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: the agent on the other end reads images off disk
 * (AttachmentStager uploads bytes and folds the remote path into the prompt),
 * so "circle the broken button and send it" was already possible — but only
 * by leaving the app, opening an editor, saving, and dragging the file back.
 * This closes that loop without adding a single main-process code path: the
 * canvas produces PNG bytes, and `{kind:'bytes'}` staging already accepts
 * exactly that.
 *
 * ## The item list is the document, not the pixels
 *
 * Strokes and text are kept as geometry and the canvas is repainted from them
 * on every change. The obvious alternative — draw straight to the context and
 * snapshot with getImageData for undo — costs a full-frame copy per stroke and
 * cannot survive a resize or a late-loading backdrop, both of which happen
 * here. The repaint is bounded by the item count, which for a doodle is tens.
 *
 * That is also why the export is trustworthy. There is ONE canvas and ONE
 * painter: `repaint()` draws the backdrop and then every item, and `commit()`
 * encodes that same canvas. Nothing is composited into a preview layer that
 * the exporter would then have to reproduce — the text tool's `<textarea>` is
 * an EDITING affordance that exists only while a caret is in it, and committing
 * it turns it into an item that `repaint()` paints like everything else. There
 * is no second rendering path that could drift.
 *
 * ## Colour, family and leading come from the DOM, not from this file
 *
 * A canvas context needs a resolved colour string and a resolved font string;
 * `var(--accent)` means nothing to it. Rather than hard-code the palette (which
 * the design gate in tests/unit/designGates.test.ts rightly forbids in a .vue
 * file, and which would silently drift from DESIGN.md), the pens name tokens
 * and resolve them from computed style at paint time. Change the token, the pen
 * follows. Text does the same for `--font-ui`, `--fw-semibold` and `--lh-300`.
 *
 * The one number NOT taken from a token is the text SIZE, and the reasoning is
 * in `TEXT.sizeRatio` in src/shared/doodleGeometry.ts: the `--fs-*` ladder is a
 * chrome density system that stops at 20px, while this canvas is a bitmap up to
 * 2048px wide. Size follows the stroke width the user already picked instead,
 * so a caption and the arrow pointing at it read as one hand.
 *
 * ## Undo covers everything, including edits and Clear
 *
 * `history` holds previous versions of the item ARRAY — a list of references,
 * tens of them, which is a different proposition from the frame-sized pixel
 * snapshots the original design rejected. It is what lets undo cover the three
 * things a pop-the-last-item stack cannot: retyping an existing annotation,
 * emptying one (which deletes it), and Clear. An annotation tool whose Clear is
 * irreversible is one misclick from losing the whole markup.

 * Keys inside the text editor.
 *
 * ENTER INSERTS A NEWLINE. It is the default, and it is left alone on purpose:
 * an annotation on a screenshot wraps and is routinely two or three lines, so
 * binding Enter to commit would make the multi-line case unreachable. Note this
 * is the OPPOSITE of the composer's own draft (§12 — bare Enter sends), and the
 * divergence is fine because they are answering different questions: the draft
 * is a message you are finishing, this is a caption you are laying out.
 *
 * ESCAPE COMMITS AND CLOSES THE EDITOR, and it does not propagate.
 *
 * The propagation half is the important half. This canvas is mounted inside an
 * OverlayPanel (Escape -> close the overlay) which is mounted inside the
 * composer's `.composer-root` (Escape -> the §12.2 ladder -> hide the whole
 * composer). Both listen for a bubbling Escape, so without `stopPropagation`
 * one keypress while typing a caption would throw away the caption, the
 * drawing, and the composer, in that order. `stopPropagation` here makes the
 * open editor the innermost rung of that same ladder — Escape closes what you
 * opened last — without either of the outer handlers needing to know this tool
 * exists.
 *
 * COMMITS, rather than cancels, because this app's Escape never destroys work:
 * §12.2 says so of the draft in as many words, and Discard is the only control
 * that throws anything away. The way to take back an annotation you did not
 * want is Ctrl+Z, which covers it — see `mutate`.
 *
 * Ctrl/Cmd+Enter also commits, matching the composer's "modifier plus Enter
 * finishes this" muscle memory for the many users who will try it first.
 *
 * Ctrl+Z is allowed to reach the textarea's native undo and is stopped from
 * reaching the sheet's: while a caret is in a text box, undo means "undo my
 * typing", not "delete the arrow I drew a minute ago".
