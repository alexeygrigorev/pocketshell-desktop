 * agree on: collapse WHOLE segments first, cut characters only out of what

   on an ancestor is the second truncation this redesign removed, and a clipped
   cell that only appears on a rounding error should not advertise itself as a
   deliberate shortening.

   The shrink FACTORS are the priority order, and the order is the whole point:
   ancestors 100, current 1, the `…` zero. Flex shares a deficit in proportion
   to `base x factor`, so a 100:1 ratio makes the ancestors absorb essentially
   all of it and bottom out at `min-width: 0` before the current gives up a
