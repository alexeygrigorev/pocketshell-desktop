/**
 * CodeEditor: the Files tab's text editor, with syntax highlighting.
 *
 * A drop-in replacement for the `<textarea>` FilesView has used since Phase 2.
 * The contract is deliberately the textarea's own — a value in, a string out —
 * so adopting it is a tag swap:
 *
 *     <textarea :value="files.openContent"
 *               @input="files.setContent($event.target.value)" />
 *     <CodeEditor :model-value="files.openContent" :filename="files.openPath"
 *                 @update:model-value="files.setContent" />
 *
 * Note the explicit `:model-value` / `@update:model-value` pair rather than
 * `v-model="files.openContent"`. `v-model` would ASSIGN to the store ref and
 * skip `setContent`, which is the only thing that raises the dirty flag — the
 * Save button would stay disabled and Ctrl+S would do nothing. Same trap the
 * textarea has (`:value`, not `v-model`), for the same reason.
 *
 * Ctrl/Cmd-S is not handled here, also deliberately. FilesView owns the chord
 * on its container; keydown from inside the editor bubbles to it because no
 * CodeMirror binding claims `Mod-s`, so save keeps working untouched.
 *
 * ## Why CodeMirror 6 and not Monaco
 *
 * Monaco is already in the repo's devDependencies and this view's header
 * comment has pointed at it for two phases, so it was the default answer. It
 * is the wrong one here, and the deciding fact was measured in the BUILT app
 * rather than reasoned about:
 *
 * The packaged renderer is loaded with `loadFile` (src/main/index.ts), so it
 * runs from a `file://` document under the CSP in src/renderer/index.html —
 * `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'`, with no `worker-src`. Under that
 * document a same-origin worker DOES run, but a worker created from a `blob:`
 * URL is refused outright ("Refused to create a worker from 'blob:file://…'
 * because it violates … script-src 'self'"). Monaco's language services are
 * workers, and the blob-wrapper shim is the shape most Monaco+Vite setups end
 * up with — which is precisely the failure that works in `dev` (an http origin
 * with Vite's own relaxed CSP) and dies in the packaged build. Making it work
 * would mean widening the app's CSP with `worker-src blob:` and pinning
 * Vite's worker format, to gain an IDE's worth of features nobody asked for on
 * top of a renderer bundle Vite already warns about.
 *
 * CodeMirror 6 needs no workers at all, and its grammars split into chunks that
 * load only when a file of that language is opened (codeEditorLanguages.ts).
 * The whole editing surface — undo, multiple cursors, bracket matching — comes
 * along, so nothing about saving over SFTP changes. A highlight-only option
 * (Shiki or highlight.js over a styled `<pre>`) was rejected outright: this
 * file is edited and written back, and re-implementing a text editor on top of
 * a read-only highlighter to keep that working is strictly more work than
 * using an editor.
