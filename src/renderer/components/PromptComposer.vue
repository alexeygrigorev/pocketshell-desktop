// PromptComposer: the app's primary interaction surface — compose a prompt,
// stage attachments, submit it into the session's tmux pane.
//
// CHROME: this is a FLOATING card, not a phone bottom sheet and no longer a
// docked bar. It hovers over the bottom-right of the session body — inset from
// the edges on every side, its own rounded corners, an elevation shadow all
// round, and only as wide as a prompt needs (~80 mono columns) so terminal
// output stays readable beside it. A sash on its top edge resizes it
// (row-resize cursor, min 190px, max 80% of the body), its height is remembered
// per session across hide/show, and a small toolbar row carries the panel title
// on the left with maximize/restore and close on the right. `Ctrl+\`` toggles
// it, matching VS Code muscle memory — and so does ONE fixed toggle pinned to
// the pane's bottom-right corner, which is present whether the card is open or
// closed and is the only control that opens and closes it. That toggle is a
// small icon button; a pip on it says a draft is waiting.
//
// NOTHING here occupies terminal space. The composer is a pure overlay: the
// pane behind it is sized as if the composer did not exist, so the terminal
// gets every row of the window.
//
// The card overlays the terminal instead of splitting the pane with it, and
// that is the point: see the block comment on `.composer-dock` in
// FolderWorkspaceView.vue. The terminal's ROW COUNT never changes when the
// composer opens, closes, moves or is dragged — no SSH window-change, no
// remote tmux reflow — because the composer contributes NOTHING to the tab
// body's layout in any state.
//
// It is mounted ONCE per session workspace, outside the tab body, so the draft,
// the caret and the staged tiles survive a tab switch.
// The draft, its attachments and the dragged height live in stores/composer.ts
// keyed by session, so switching sessions swaps records rather than destroying
// a draft; open-vs-closed does NOT, because that is a preference about the tool
// rather than a fact about a session (§12).
//
// Three deliberate divergences from the Android original (docs/COMPOSER.md):
//
//  1. §12 — a third `hidden` mode that leaves the toggle behind, instead of
//     the phone's "the sheet is simply gone". A preserved "Not sent" draft must
//     stay discoverable; the toggle wears a pip when one is waiting.
//  2. §12.3 — a SUCCESSFUL send does NOT hide the composer. The phone dismisses
//     its sheet on delivery because a modal sheet occludes the terminal on a
//     phone screen; here the composer is where the user works, so it stays open
//     and focused, ready for the next prompt.
//  3. §16.2 — the payload is bracketed-paste framed by this renderer. Android
//     gets that for free from `tmux -CC` control mode; we write into a plain PTY
//     running `tmux attach`, and without the framing every line of an
//     `Attached files:` block becomes a separate agent prompt.
//
// What it does NOT do, and must not grow: it never mutates the draft when you
// attach something (the paths are folded in at send time only, §5.1), it never
// clears the draft optimistically on send (#745), and Escape never destroys
// work — only Discard does (§4.3).

 *    means a clipboard we are going to ignore costs one cheap type listing.
 *  - `openComposer()` happens BEFORE the await on `stageFiles`, so the panel is

 *    afterwards would leave the user staring at an unchanged terminal for the
 *    length of an SFTP put with no sign their keystroke registered.

 * clipboard — or one holding only a format the attachment path cannot use — is
 * `kind: 'none'`, and this returns having touched nothing: no mode change, no
 * focus change, no suppression lifted. A composer that pops open empty is worse
 * than a keystroke that did nothing, because the user has to put it away again.
 *
 * Both live branches lift the dismissal suppression, and neither does it by
 * hand: `openComposer` and `typeInto` both go through the store's `setMode`,
 * which clears `typingSuppressed` on any opening because "any opening is a
 * summons". An explicit Ctrl+V is as much a summons as Ctrl+` is, so that is
 * the behaviour wanted — and taking it from the one place that already decides

 *    nothing tells you until you go looking.
 *  - MOUSEDOWN, not click, and gated on where the press LANDED. The card can be
 *    dragged and resized, and both routinely travel outside its own bounds
 *    before the button comes up; gating on the press means an interaction that
 *    STARTED inside the composer can never dismiss it, however far it goes.
 *  - Anything inside `.composer-root` is inside the composer — the card, the
 *    grips, the header, the pinned toggle and the doodle overlay are all its
 *    descendants. So the toggle's own click is never a "click outside": it is
 *    ignored here and handled by the toggle, which is what stops a close here
 *    racing a re-open there and reading as a flicker or as nothing at all.
 *
 * It does NOT suppress the typing intercept, and that is the interesting call.
 * Escape and the chord are gestures aimed AT the composer and mean "leave me
 * alone", so they suppress (§12.2). A click elsewhere is incidental — the
 * user reached for the terminal, not against the composer — and the composer
 * was empty, so nothing was lost. Typing afterwards almost certainly means they
 * want it back, which is the premise of §26.1. The split is: a CLICK dismisses

 * their own events back, because this layer covers the whole pane and would

 * works: pointer-events governs hit-testing, not the propagation of an event

/* ---- the fixed toggle ---------------------------------------------------
 * ONE control, two states, ONE position. Pinned to the pane's bottom-right
 * corner and the only thing that opens and closes the panel, so the user aims
 * at a single unmoving pixel and it alternates — which a control living on
 * the card could never do, because the card moves.
 *
 * It is SMALL but it is not SHY, and that distinction cost a revision. It began
 * as a 24px mark at `opacity: 0.55`, on the reasoning that an overlay drawing
 * over tmux's status line should defer to it until wanted. The user, running
 * it: *"the ^ icon should be an overlay over the terminal not hiding in the
 * corner it's almost invisible."* They were right, and the error was one of
 * category: this is not decoration that can afford to recede, it is the ONLY
 * way to summon the composer once it is closed. A control nobody can find is
 * broken, not subtle.
 *
 * So it is a CHIP, not a mark: an opaque `--surface-2` fill, a `--border-strong`
 * edge and the card's own elevation shadow. `--border-strong` is not a taste
 * call — DESIGN.md §4.2 requires it (4.12:1) wherever a boundary is the only
 * thing identifying a control, and here it is the only thing separating a chip
 * from the terminal behind it. At 28px/16px it is on POLISH.md §2.7's default
 * scale rather than its dense one, which is right for a primary affordance.
 *
 * It is inset a further `--sp-3` from the dock's own corner, so it visibly
 * floats ON the terminal instead of hugging the pane's edge, and that offset
 * also lifts it clear of almost the whole status row rather than sitting in it.
 *
 * What it is NOT is the old wide rail: the user asked for "smaller and an icon"
 * and liked that; the fix was contrast and placement, not size.
 *
 * It is pinned, so it is never dragged: a click here is unambiguously a click.
