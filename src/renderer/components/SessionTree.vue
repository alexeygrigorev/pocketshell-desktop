// SessionTree: the live tmux session list for the active connection, as a
// FOLDER VIEW — TWO levels, root then folder, one row per folder
// (docs/WORKSPACE.md §2, revising docs/SESSIONLIST.md revision 3):
//
//   git                          12
//     dtc-website           2       21h
//     pocketshell           3       21h

//   other                           3
//
// The root line carries no disclosure mark because it is not a node: it is a
// grouping HEADER over the folder rows beneath it, and there is nothing under
// it that hiding would spare the reader. See the root row in the template for
// why that is deliberate and what a future collapse must not do.
//
// It does carry a `+`, revealed on hover or focus, which creates a session
// under that root — and that is not a contradiction of the paragraph above. A
// chevron would promise a STATE the row does not have; a `+` promises an
// action, which it does. The panel's foot button went when this arrived; see
// the end of the template.
//
// ## Why the session level went, and why this is not revision 2 again
//
// Revision 3 made this `root -> folder -> session`, and the load-bearing
// sentence in it was "the directory row is no longer selectable: clicking it
// expands". The session leaf existed because it was the ONLY way to reach a
// session — selecting one was a panel operation, so the panel needed a row per
// session to select. That is no longer true. A folder row opens a folder
// WORKSPACE whose tab bar already carries every session in the folder, always
// visible, one click away, so the leaf now spends a row on a navigation step
// something else already performs.
//
// Revisions 1 and 2 removed the folder header CONDITIONALLY — when a folder
// held one session — which made the panel's shape depend on its contents and
// change under the refresh timer; a tree whose nodes collapse whenever they
// hold one child does not read as a tree. This is the opposite: there is no
// session level for ANY folder, whatever it holds, so the panel is always two
// deep and a reader can predict its shape without knowing what is running.
// SESSIONLIST §1's measurement is not overturned — it said a level must earn
// its rows, and this one no longer does.
//
// An untracked session (`dir.untracked` — no reported cwd) still renders as a
// single row in the folder slot, and it is now selectable like
// any other folder: its workspace holds that one session. See
// docs/WORKSPACE.md §6 for why it must stay reachable rather than merely
// visible, and for the sibling inference that gives most of these a real
// folder before they ever get here.
//
// What survives from the flat design, unchanged:
//   - attached sessions pin to the top of their root with a green dot and a
//     semibold label. The `attached` text tag stays retired: position, weight
//     and colour already say it.
//   - the timestamp is relative (`12m`), absolute in the tooltip.
//   - labels middle-truncate, so `git-pocketshell` and `git-pocketshell-quse`
//     stop rendering identically when the panel is narrow.
//   - the tooltip carries the full truth: session name, full path, absolute
//     time.

 * docs/WORKSPACE.md refer to "the refresh timer" a dozen times over — the
 * argument against keying a row's shape off `directories.length` (§3a), the
 * rule that expansion state must never watch the root list, the tab order
 * being stored as a RANKING because "sessions arrive on the refresh timer, and
 * vanish when they are killed here, from the phone or from the user's own
 * terminal", and the repo-root cache recording negatives so it does not put a
 * git process on the host "every few seconds forever". Every one of those is a
 * decision taken to survive a poll. The poll was not here. The only
 * `setInterval` in the whole renderer was the cosmetic clock above.
 *
 * The symptom is precisely the one reported: a session that goes away leaves
 * its folder row sitting in the panel. The store is only re-read on mount, on
 * the Refresh button, and at the few call sites that follow their own write —
 * so a session stopped from the phone, from a terminal, by an agent exiting,
 * or by a stop whose follow-up refresh did not land, stays on screen until the
 * user hits Refresh or navigates somewhere that happens to re-read it. The
 * folder row is not wrong about anything; nothing ever told it.
 *
 * ## Why five seconds
 *
 * It is the "every few seconds" the repo-root cache was already designed
 * against, and it is the interval the port dashboard settled on for the same
 * kind of question. It has to be well under a minute for "I stopped it and it
 * is still there" to stop being a bug report, and well over one second for the
 * two execs a listing costs not to be a load on someone's box.

/* ── Dragging a folder row up and down (docs/SESSIONLIST.md §14) ───────────
 * > "but I can also pull them up and down to rearraange"
 *
 * The same native HTML5 drag the workspace's tab bar uses (docs/WORKSPACE.md
 * §15.4), turned ninety degrees. It is deliberately the same family and not a
 * pointer-events implementation of its own: the two are one gesture in the
 * user's hands — drag a thing along the strip it lives in — and a panel that
 * felt different from the tab bar would be a second thing to learn for nothing.
 *
 * All three of the rules the tab drag obeys carry over unchanged:
 *
 *   - **the drag does not fight the click.** A row is a `<button>` that
 *     navigates, and native DnD suppresses the `click` that would otherwise
 *     follow a drag — which is exactly what the tab bar already relies on for
 *     its own `<button class="tab" draggable>`. So dragging a row does not open
 *     its workspace, and nothing here has to guess at a threshold or swallow a
 *     click after the fact. The row's other behaviours are untouched for the
 *     same reason: the context menu is a right-button gesture and a drag is a
 *     left-button one, and `draggable` changes nothing about the keyboard, so
 *     Enter/Space still activate the row and `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓` still walk it.
 *   - **the dragged row fades but stays in place.** Removing it from the flow
 *     would shift every row below it the instant the drag began, moving the
 *     target the user is aiming at at precisely the wrong moment.
 *   - **the landing place is drawn**, as a 2px accent rule in the gap. Without
 *     it a reorder is "let go and find out", and the one rule this drag
 *     enforces — a row cannot leave its root — is invisible unless something
 *     draws it. A refused drop draws nothing, and that absence IS the refusal.

 * reasoning as `creating` holding one object instead of a boolean and a path:
 * the poll re-reads the session list every few seconds, so `home` and the row
 * set can both move between the right-click and the click on the item. Resolved
 * once, the enabled/disabled state the user SAW and the folder the dialog gets
 * cannot disagree; re-derived, they could, and the way that failure presents is
 * a session created somewhere the user did not point at.
 *
 * `rootHostPath` is named for the root row's `+` but it is not root-specific —
 * it is the inverse of `directoryKey`, and `dir.path` is exactly what
 * `directoryKey` produced (`~/git/dataqna`). Reusing it is what keeps one rule
 * for turning a grouping key back into a real host directory, rather than a
 * second expansion free to drift from the first. It answers null for an
 * untracked folder, which is the case the item is disabled for.
 *
 * Nothing here selects the row, and that is deliberate — the workspace's tab
 * menu takes the same position. A right-click the user then dismisses would
 * otherwise have already navigated them somewhere else.

 * sessions that has no other single lever. The workspace's tab menu can stop
 * one session (docs/WORKSPACE.md §14); stopping a folder's four means opening
 * that workspace and confirming four times.
 *
 * It is called Stop, not Close, and that is not a synonym chosen at random.
 * `Close` in this app closes a TAB and leaves the session running; the word for
 * killing the tmux session is `Stop`, on the tab menu and in its dialog. Two
 * words for one destructive act, in two menus a click apart, is how a user ends
 * up believing one of them is the safe one.
 *
 * Everything §14 says about the single kill holds here and is multiplied: no
 * undo, and each session is usually an agent mid-task. So the item is
 * separated, tinted, and behind a confirmation that NAMES the sessions — which
 * matters more from this panel than from the tab bar, because a folder row does
 * not show them. The one thing the user can see is a count.

 * worth at once is the load the session poll is already guarded against; and a
 * partial failure has to be reportable by NAME, which a settled array can give
 * but which is much easier to get wrong when the failures interleave.
 *
 * `not-found` counts as success, exactly as the single kill treats it
 * (docs/WORKSPACE.md §14.2): the panel refreshes on a timer, so a session that
 * went away between the right-click and the confirm is the ordinary case, and
 * the state the user asked for is the state that exists.
 *
 * The refusal is worded as the tab bar words its own (`createError`): the
 * session in double quotes, and the host's sentence carried rather than
 * replaced. It names the sessions instead of counting them — `1 of 2` says how
 * much of the folder is still up, but not WHICH, and the name is the only half
 * of that the user can act on.
 *
 * The composer record is dropped per session, and only for the ones that
 * actually died — it is the third row of §14.3's table, and the only one of the
 * three this component can reach. The pool's client goes main-side from the ipc
 * handler whatever the caller is, and the workspace's mounted pane unmounts on
 * its own: `sessionPanes` is filtered against the live tabs, so a session that
 * leaves the listing takes its terminal with it.

           "Start a session here" button, FolderWorkspaceView.vue): say what is
           empty AND offer the one useful action. The button opens the same

         they were already pointing; and it stands in for the whole SET of
         sessions in that folder, which is the only lever that stops them
         together rather than one workspace tab at a time.

         Separated and tinted, the tab menu's rule (docs/WORKSPACE.md §14): the
         separator says "another group", the `--error` colour says "another KIND
         of thing", and the one item here that can lose work must not look like
         the one that cannot.

         `.prevent` on the handler, not a global suppression: in a packaged
         Electron app the default here is Chromium's own menu, which carries
         nothing that applies to a session row. It is the same `.prevent` the
         file tree's rows and the workspace's session tabs use — the
         application MENU BAR is a separate thing, nulled in main (169cf60),
         and neither disarms the other.

         DISABLED rather than absent when the folder has no directory we can
         resolve — an untracked session, or a `~`-keyed folder on a host whose
         `$HOME` never came back. Same rule the root `+` follows and for the
         same reason: the action is real and the host is temporarily unable to
         answer, so the title says which of those it is. An item that quietly
         vanishes reads as a feature that was never there. -->

/* ── The per-root `+`: revealed, not persistent ────────────────────────────
   HOVER- AND FOCUS-REVEALED, and this is the decision the control turned on.

   Persistent was the alternative and it is affordable on width — the root
   labels are short words (`git`, `tmp`) and a 24px square leaves plenty at the
   232px floor. What it is not affordable on is NOISE: one `+` per root is a
   column of identical marks running down a panel whose entire job is to be
   scanned, repeating an affordance that is identical on every row. VS Code's
   tree-row actions reach the same conclusion for the same reason.

   Two rules make the reveal honest rather than merely quiet:

     - it is `opacity`, never `display`. The square is always laid out, so the
       root label never reflows when the cursor arrives — a row that changes
       width under the pointer is worse than a mark that was always there.
     - `:focus-visible` reveals it too, so it is fully reachable by keyboard and
       VISIBLE once reached. A hover-only affordance is one a keyboard user can
       tab into and not see, which is the failure mode this pattern usually
       ships with.

   `@media (hover: none)` shows it unconditionally: a pointer that cannot hover
   would otherwise never reveal it at all.

   What it is deliberately NOT conditioned on is whether the root is empty. An
   empty registered root is the `+`'s most useful case, but `directories.length`
   changes under the sessions store's refresh timer, so keying visibility off it
   would make the control appear and disappear as sessions come and go — the
   same trap the root rows' own comment records about expansion state. Every
   root row carries the same mark, always, in the same place. */
/* `margin-left: auto` is what keeps the `+` on the right edge now that the
   count no longer holds it there. It is the one control in this row rather
   than a field, so it is the one that belongs in the right column — and
   because the square is always LAID OUT (only its opacity changes), the label
   and count never reflow when the cursor arrives. */

 * while the drag is still in the air.
 *
 * `inset` box-shadow rather than a real border, exactly as the tabs do it: a
 * border would change the row's height and shove the whole list down by 2px as
 * the indicator moved between gaps, which is the same "target moves under the

   step stays 8px — 18px of padding plus its 2px selection rail — which is the
   whole of the nesting this panel expresses.

   Dropping the chevron gives every row 18px back. At the 232px panel floor the

/* Below ~270px the row cannot hold every field. The timestamp goes first: it

   died with the recency sort (docs/SESSIONLIST.md §6). What survives the
   revision is the comparison rather than the absolute: at the 232px floor
   something has to go, and every other field on the row either identifies it
   (label), locates it (dot) or says what is running in it (badge), and an age
   answers none of those. It is a genuine loss at that width now rather than a
   redundancy, and it is recorded as one. Dot, label and badge survive to the
   232px floor. The
   rule is unscoped on purpose, so a directory header drops its aggregate age
   at the same width its children drop theirs — a header still showing a time
   above rows that had theirs removed would read as its own, separate fact.
   270 rather than revision 2's 250, by the same arithmetic that set 250: the
   leaf row is 16px deeper than the single-session row it replaces, and it now
   carries a full session name rather than a short directory basename, so it
   runs out of width that much sooner. */
