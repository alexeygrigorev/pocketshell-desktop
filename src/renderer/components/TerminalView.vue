// TerminalView: an xterm.js terminal attached to an SSH shell channel.
//
// On mount it asks main for the PTY that should be on screen and wires
// xterm <-> the shell:
//   - shell stdout bytes -> xterm.write
//   - xterm user input   -> shell.input
//   - xterm resize       -> shell.resize
// On unmount it closes the shell.
//
// ONE OF THESE PER SESSION TAB, and staying mounted is the whole point. For a
// tmux session it calls `shell.attachSession`, and main answers with a PTY that
// belongs to that session for as long as the tab lives
// (src/main/ssh/TmuxClientPool.ts). Anything else (a bare shell) still goes
// through `shell.open`.
//
// The workspace keeps a TerminalView mounted for every session tab the user has
// visited and merely HIDES the inactive ones, so switching tabs moves no bytes
// and asks the host nothing: each xterm already holds its own session's screen.
// What this replaced was one TerminalView re-pointed by `session-key`, which
// cost a `tmux switch-client` exec plus a full-screen repaint over SSH on every
// click — p50 210 ms on the user's own host, and most attempts failed outright
// and paid a full re-join instead.
//
// `session-key` therefore no longer changes underneath a folder-workspace pane,
// but the watcher on it stays: nothing here assumes it is fixed, and a caller
// with a genuinely re-pointable pane still needs it.
//
// The ask-then-adopt order in `showTarget` stays too. It costs nothing, and it
// is what stops a re-attach closing a PTY main was about to hand back.

/**

 * ## The picture this exists for

 * about four columns — `I'd` / `just` / `poi` / `nt` / `out`, one fragment per
 * row — with correctly-wrapped full-width text above and below it, and a live
 * agent TUI still drawing its input box at that width long after the pane was
 * wide again.
 *
 * That picture can only be made by the REMOTE. tmux and the TUI inside it wrap
 * to the width they were told, and their scrollback keeps the wrap it was
 * written with; nothing on this side re-flows text that has already been
 * printed. So something sent a resize of roughly four columns, the agent
 * reflowed its whole view to it, and the correct size that followed repaired
 * only what was redrawn afterwards. The damage is not recoverable — which is
 * what makes a bogus push worth refusing rather than correcting.
 *
 * ## Why the existing guard did not catch it
 *
 * There has been a degenerate-geometry guard here since inactive tabs started
 * staying mounted, and it asks the right question of the wrong quantity: it
 * tests the container for ZERO pixels (`clientWidth`/`clientHeight`), because
 * the case it was written for is a `v-show`'d pane, which measures exactly 0.
 * A container that is 30px wide is not zero, is not a pane anyone is looking
 * at, and produces a four-column fit — every transient layout that has a
 * non-zero width on its way to its real one walks straight through the guard.
 *
 * ## Why these numbers
 *
 * They are chosen to be UNREACHABLE by a real pane rather than to be the
 * smallest usable terminal. The session panel is clamped to 560px
 * (`MAX_PANEL_WIDTH`), the composer is an overlay and takes no rows from the
 * pane, and the window has an OS minimum — so a grid this small is not a
 * cramped layout, it is a measurement taken mid-transition. 20 columns is
 * narrower than any terminal anyone has ever worked in on purpose, and 5 rows
 * is narrower than the tmux status line plus a prompt.
 *
 * A pane that really is smaller than this keeps the last size the far end was
 * told, which is the honest failure: tmux draws a screen bigger than the
 * viewport and the user sees part of it, instead of the agent reflowing its
 * session to a width the user cannot read and cannot undo.

/**
 * Make the far end's idea of our geometry true, and repaint if it was not.
 *
 * ## The bug this is the answer to
 *
 * The user saw a tmux status line sitting eighteen rows above the bottom of
 * the pane, with the same stale line repeated underneath it to the edge. That
 * picture has exactly one cause: xterm has more rows than the PTY was told
 * about, so tmux drew its status line at what it believed was the last row and
 * never touched anything below. The rows below are not corrupt — they are
 * cells nobody has written since the pane was last bigger.
 *
 * ## Why the previous wiring let that happen
 *
 * Geometry reached the far end through `term.onResize`, which fires only when
 * xterm's OWN dimensions change. Two holes follow from that, and both are live
 * now that every opened tab stays mounted:
 *
 *  1. **A resize with no shell to send it to.** A tab joins by opening an SSH
 *     channel, a login shell and `tmuxctl` — 1.5-2 s on this user's host. The
 *     pane is laid out during that window (the tab strip settles, the composer
 *     docks), so `fit()` runs and `onResize` fires while `shellId` is still
 *     null, and the handler drops it. `showTarget` then sent the cols/rows it
 *     had captured BEFORE the await, which are the pre-layout numbers. The far
 *     end is told a size the pane no longer has, and nothing ever corrects it,
 *     because from xterm's side the dimensions are not going to change again.
 *
 *  2. **A size that is right on our side and stale on theirs.** A pane that
 *     comes back into view at the size it had when it was hidden produces no
 *     `onResize` at all, so a client that has meanwhile been resized by
 *     anything else — another client on the same session, a re-join — is never
 *     put back.
 *
 * Recording what was sent closes both: the comparison is against the REMOTE's
 * last known state rather than against our own previous dimensions, so a route
 * that changes nothing locally still sends when the remote is behind, and a
 * route that fires twice sends once.
 *
 * ## Why a repaint follows
 *
 * A resize tmux considers a no-op repaints nothing, and the stale band is
 * exactly the region tmux does not think it owns. `refresh-client` targeted at
 * our own client is the clean way to say "draw all of it" without changing
 * anything else; sending `C-l` into the PTY would be interpreted by whatever
 * is running instead. It is asked for only when we actually pushed something,
 * so an idle tab costs no host work.

  // It is here anyway, and it is NOT belt-and-braces: it is the answer to what

  // the chord's meaning does not depend on who mounted the terminal.
  //
  // ## What is NOT in this list any more
  //
  // `Ctrl+1`..`Ctrl+9` used to be declined here, for the jump-to-Nth-tab
  // family; the user asked for it to go ("remove ctrl 1 2 3 hotkey"). Then the
  // CYCLE went — `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` ("remove these hotkeys let's
  // keep only ctrl left and ctrl right") — and finally the arrows themselves,
  // when the pair moved onto brackets because they collided with word-jump in
  // text fields. Every removal HANDS KEYS BACK to the shell rather than merely
  // tidying up:
  //
  //   Ctrl+3..Ctrl+8  -> `ESC`, `FS`, `GS`, `RS`, `US`, `DEL` (`Ctrl+3` is a
  //                      common stand-in for Escape).

  //                      shell prompt this is completion again.
  //   Ctrl+Shift+Tab  -> ESC [ Z (back-tab).
  //   Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→   -> ESC [ 1 ; 5 D / C, readline's backward/forward-word.
  //
  // A chord this app no longer claims must reach the program the user is
  // actually talking to. `Ctrl+Shift+PageUp`/`PageDown` were never declined
  // here in the first place: xterm's own scrollback is what they do.
  //
  // `preventDefault()` AND `return false`, both, for the third time in this

  // false stops xterm (`_keyDown` bails at the custom handler and never calls
  // its own `cancel()`) but leaves the DOM event LIVE. One keystroke, two
  // paths, is bc86cf7 and 3628090.

  // real characters on several of them and none of it is ours.
  //
  // The chord is DATA (src/shared/shortcuts.ts) and this branch only DECLINES
  // it. Reading the registry rather than restating it here is the point:
  // this copy and FolderWorkspaceView's are the two that would otherwise drift,

  // Ctrl+V was claimed first, and it was affordable only because it was
  // measured: on this exact xterm (3628090) plain Ctrl+V produces a single
  // `\x16` through xterm's own ctrl-letter mapping and pastes NOTHING. What it
  // costs is readline's literal-next (`quoted-insert`, bound to `\x16`), which
  // some people do use at a bash prompt; `Ctrl+Q` is bound to the same command
  // in vi mode and nothing here claims it.
  //
  // Ctrl+SHIFT+V now joins it, and that was the user's report: "when I paste
  // using ctrl+shift+v it goes directly to terminal but should go to prompt
  // composer". It is the chord every terminal emulator trains into people's
  // hands, so it is the one they reach for FIRST — and a pane where one paste
  // chord opens the composer and its twin dumps the clipboard into the shell
  // does not have two features, it has a coin toss. Which of the two fires is
  // not something a user can feel before the paste has already landed
  // somewhere, and one of those landings runs whatever was on the clipboard as
  // shell input.
  //
  // The shell keeps its paste: RIGHT-CLICK (`onTerminalContextMenu`), which is
  // still a chord-free, one-gesture route to the same place and is documented
  // as such. That is deliberate — pasting a command to run at a prompt is a
  // real thing to want, it just no longer sits on the key most likely to be
  // pressed by reflex.
  //
  // `!e.altKey` stays OUTSIDE the chord test, because it is not part of the
  // chord: Ctrl+Alt is how AltGr arrives on European layouts, and AltGr+V is a
  // printable character on several of them. A user typing `@` or `~` must not
  // have it swallowed by the composer, and no chord table can express "and
  // definitely not AltGr".
  //
  // preventDefault IS THE FEATURE here for the third time in this function, and
  // for the third identical reason — returning false stops xterm (`_keyDown`
  // bails at the custom handler and never calls its own `cancel()`) but leaves
  // the DOM event LIVE, so Chromium performs its own default action on top of
  // ours. It has been measured doing exactly that twice: Ctrl+Shift+V is
  // `pasteAndMatchStyle`, which fires a `paste` on xterm's textarea that xterm
  // turns into a second write (3628090), and Ctrl+V is an ordinary paste into
  // whatever holds focus — about to be the composer's draft, which would then
  // receive the clipboard twice. One keystroke, two paths, is bc86cf7 and
  // 3628090; this line is what closes the native one.

 * clipped or a dead band opens under tmux's status line — and, worse, the PTY
 * on the far end is never told, so tmux keeps drawing to the old geometry.
 * That is the same class of failure as the sliced status line fixed in
 * 7d7cdad, arriving by a different route. Measured on this exact xterm
 * (6.0.0) rather than assumed: 16px -> 24px takes an 800x600 pane from 87x30
 * to 58x20 and the row box from 19px to 28px, and only after the fit.
 *
 * ZOOM gets there differently and still ends up here. A CSS pixel is
 * zoom-invariant, so the cell does NOT change size in CSS px — what changes is
 * how many of them fit, because the window's viewport in CSS px shrinks or
 * grows. The container's ResizeObserver does see that and would usually fit on
 * its own; zoom is watched anyway so the refit is a stated consequence of the
 * setting rather than a side effect of an observer two layers away. It costs
 * one coalesced fit.
 *
 * Reassigning the font options on a zoom-only change is free: xterm's
 * OptionsService compares before it fires, so an identical value is a no-op
 * and does not trigger a re-measure.
 *
 * `scheduleFit()` rather than a bare `fitAddon.fit()`: it coalesces to one fit
 * per frame, which also gives xterm a frame to re-measure the new cell, and it
 * skips the degenerate 0x0 measurement of a hidden pane that a bare fit would
 * push at the remote as a 1x1 terminal. (A pane hidden behind another tab is
 * exactly that case, and it needs no retry latch: `v-show` toggling back on is
 * itself a size change, so the ResizeObserver fires and fits with whatever the
 * settings became while it was hidden.) The resize reaches the shell through
 * the already-bound `term.onResize` handler — there is nothing extra to send.

 * runs — unbind the dead streams, `reset()` the grid (the dead tmux client
 * never sent its mode-teardown, same reasoning as the reset in that branch),

/**
 * Watch the far end, repair what is ours, repaint what is not, and re-join

 *
 * ## Why this has to exist after all the wiring above
 *
 * Every route above reads true from the same assumption: before sending a
 * size we compare against {@link sent}, what the far end was last TOLD. Two
 * classes of failure defeat that by construction, and the loop is shaped
 * around them:
 *
 *   1. **The far end moved something we control.** Our client's tty size can
 *      end up other than what we pushed — a resize lost in a transient, a
 *      layout that settled wrong. The probe answers
 *      `#{client_width} #{client_height}` — the size of OUR client's tty, the
 *      quantity {@link pushGeometry} sets — and a mismatch is repaired by
 *      {@link resyncDisplay}: push the true size again, repaint.
 *   2. **The far end moved something we do not control, or control nothing
 *      about.** Under `window-size latest`, another client of the session —
 *      the phone, the user's own terminal — can take the window; and a
 *      desync between xterm's parser state and the client's byte stream can
 *      garble a pane at CONSTANT geometry, which no comparison of sizes can
 *      ever detect. Both are answered the same way the user answered them by
 *      hand: a full repaint, asked on the clock while healthy (item 2's only
 *      cure), and once per episode when the window has been taken (item 1's
 *      honest picture). We never FIGHT for the window: there is no portable
 *      way to reclaim `latest` (measured on tmux 3.4: `resize-window -c`
 *      does not exist, `refresh-client -C` is control-mode-only), and a
 *      resize war between two active clients would garble both.
 *
 * ## The exit that is not an exit: re-joining on `dead`
 *
 * A probe that cannot be answered — the handshake variable never published,
 * the client detached, the tmux server restarted under the session — used to
 * read as `null`, indistinguishable from healthy agreement, and the pane sat
 * frozen or garbled forever behind a repair path that had quietly died. The
 * probe now answers `dead`, and two `dead`s in a row do what the user did by
 * hand: close the shell and join the session fresh. The fresh join is the one
 * repair that re-initialises BOTH ends — a new tmux client sends its complete
 * stream, and the terminal is reset before it binds. Bounded by
 * {@link REJOIN_MIN_INTERVAL_MS} and {@link MAX_CONSECUTIVE_REJOINS} so a
 * genuinely gone session cannot be hammered; a pane the user exited on purpose
 * never reaches here at all, because its channel is dead and `shellGone`
 * gates the tick.
 *
 * ## The guards, in order
 *
 * A dead or never-opened shell does nothing (`shellGone` is set by exit; an
 * evicted tab recovers through `scheduleFit`, not here). An obscured window
 * (`document.hidden`) and a hidden pane (the zero-measure case behind another
 * tab) skip the round trip entirely, because only the pane someone is LOOKING
 * AT needs to be right promptly — exactly what makes the interval affordable
 * when the channel budget counts. And since the answer takes a network round
 * trip to arrive, everything below the await re-reads the world instead of
 * trusting the world that asked.

 * `border-box` they are not. With the padding here, it read this box as 684px
 * while the content box was 668px, asked for 36 rows x 19px = 684px, and
 * overflowed by exactly the 16px of `--term-padding` — which `overflow:

 * That is the line the user reads constantly to know which session they are
