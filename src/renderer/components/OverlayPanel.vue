 * obscured background — and closing restored nothing. So: on mount, remember
 * where focus was and move it into the panel (the `tabindex="-1"` below is
 * what makes a plain div focusable), so keyboard events start inside the
 * dialog and the `role="dialog"`/`aria-label` are announced; on unmount, hand
 * focus back, best-effort — the trigger may be gone by then (a session row
 * that closed itself), hence the `isConnected` guard.
 *
 * Two deliberate limits. A full focus TRAP — cycling Tab at the panel's edges,
 * inert-ing the background — was considered and deferred: it is a page of
 * subtle code for a marginal gain here, since every panel is dismissed by
 * Escape and none is long enough for Tab to walk off the end of in practice.
 * And the panel must not STEAL focus from its own content: several dialogs
 * focus a field of their own as they mount, and slot children mount before
 * this component's mounted hook runs, so we only take focus when none of them
 * already did.
