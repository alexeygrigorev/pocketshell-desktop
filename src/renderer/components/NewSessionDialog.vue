// NewSessionDialog: folder-first session creation.
//
// This replaces the bare "new session name" field that used to sit at the
// bottom of SessionTree. That field had the model backwards. A session is not
// named, it is PLACED: the user picks a project folder on the host and the
// session name is DERIVED from it (`~/git/pocketshell` -> `git-pocketshell`)
// by the same rule `tmuxctl` and the Android app use, so all three clients
// agree about which session belongs to which folder. The derived name is shown
// in the footer before anything is committed; it is never typed.
//
// Three routes, one destination:
//
//   existing  browse to a folder that is already there
//   new       create an empty folder under the folder you browsed to
//   clone     clone a GitHub repo (or reuse one already on the host)
//
// All three converge on `projects.startSession(folder)`.
//
// Browsing deliberately goes through the SFTP surface (`projects.home()` for
// the root, `sftp.list()` filtered to directories) rather than a folder
// channel of its own — see src/renderer/stores/projects.ts.
//
// ## The second question: which agent (docs/SESSIONLIST.md §13)
//
// This dialog used to answer only "which folder" and stop, on the reasoning
// that the folder's workspace asks "which agent" one click later. The user
// asked for the chain explicitly — "when I start a session in a folder I want
// to select the agent" — so `Start session…` now raises the SAME
// `LaunchSessionDialog` the workspace's `+` raises. Not a copy of its fields:
// `src/shared/agentLaunch.ts` is the only place that knows how to spell a
// flag, and one dialog in front of it is what keeps that true.
//
// **Nothing is created until BOTH questions are answered.** That is the
// property `LaunchSessionDialog` was built around (cancel costs nothing) and
// §13's real objection to chaining, so the chain is ordered to preserve it
// rather than to work around it: the agent step runs on the PREDICTED folder —
// `targetFolder`, which every route can name before it exists — and the whole
// commit path (mkdir, clone, `start`) runs on confirm. Cancelling at the agent
// step leaves no folder, no clone and no session, and returns to the picker
// with the browse intact. See {@link commit}.
//
// **The launch itself is not run here**, because it cannot be: typing the
// wrapper line needs a PTY and the panel has no terminal. The choice is PARKED
// (`src/renderer/pendingAgentLaunch.ts`) and `FolderWorkspaceView` collects it
// when the user opens the session. So "create" and "launch" are separated in
// time, and the launch rides the navigation this dialog asks for rather than
// this dialog growing a terminal of its own.
//
// A plain shell is untouched by all of this and stays ONE click: `Start shell`
// beside the primary button commits with no choice at all, exactly as `Start
// session` did before this change.
//
// A create that WORKS opens the session, immediately. There used to be a green
// "Started `git-dataqna`" banner with an `Open session` button under it, and it
// was a screen whose only content was the good news: the user had pressed
// Start, the host had done exactly what was asked, and the dialog answered with
// a receipt and a second click. Success is not news — it is the thing that was
// asked for — so `commit` emits `started` the moment the host names the session
// and the panel navigates. See {@link commit}.
//
// The outcome panel survives for the answers that are NOT simply "yes", because
// two of them cannot be read off the session row afterwards:
// `via: 'tmux-fallback'` means the session was created WITHOUT a memory cap,
// and `code: 'folder-missing'` guards a real helper trap where a `-c` at a
// missing directory exits 0 and silently lands the pane in `$HOME`. Both are
// worth a sentence, so in those cases the dialog stays put, says it, and the
// user presses Open (or goes round again) having read it.
