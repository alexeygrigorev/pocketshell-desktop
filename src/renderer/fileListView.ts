/**
 * What the Files tab's tree actually renders: a capped, optionally filtered
 * slice of the directory listing, plus a breadcrumb that fits on one line.
 *
 * Pure on purpose — this is the whole of the logic and none of it needs a DOM
 * (`tests/unit/fileListView.test.ts`).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHERE THE COST IS — AND SO WHAT "LOAD FIRST 100" MEANS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * It is a RENDER cap, not a fetch limit, and the difference decides the whole
 * design. `api.sftp.list` is one `sftp.readdir` (SftpService.list:96) — the
 * SFTP layer streams the directory to completion inside a single call and
 * hands back the whole array. There is no cursor, no per-entry round trip, and
 * nothing to page: a 4,000-entry folder costs one request whose reply is
 * proportional to N, which on a LAN is milliseconds and on a bad link is one
 * slow reply rather than forty.
 *
 * What is NOT cheap is the other end. Every entry becomes a row with an icon
 * component and three spans, and Vue diffs all of them on every listing
 * change; that is the part that makes a big folder feel bad. So the cap is
 * applied to what we RENDER, the store keeps the full listing it already
 * fetched, and {@link viewFileRows} filters over ALL of it. Searching
 * therefore never needs another round trip and never misses a file just
 * because it sits past the cap — which is the failure mode of capping the
 * fetch instead.
 *
 * (If a host ever does make `readdir` itself slow — a network filesystem, an
 * enormous directory — that is a different fix, in SftpService, and it would
 * need a paging API SFTP's `readdir` does not naturally expose. Nothing here
 * papers over it: the row count shown is the true total.)

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THE RESEARCH SAID, AND WHY THIS FUNCTION HAS THE SHAPE IT HAS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The predecessor of this code collapsed the middle of the path to a fixed
// four cells and then ran each SURVIVING cell through `splitLabel`, so a
// 250px pane rendered `~ / … / v…previews / olya-…` — two different
// truncations of the same fact stacked on top of each other, with the folder
// the user is actually standing in the one that got cut. That is the identical
// failure `b841362` deleted from the session rows. It came back because the
// collapse rule was STRUCTURAL (always four cells, whatever the width), so it
// could not do the work at a narrow width and character truncation had to
// finish the job.
//
// Every implementation that was read does the two operations in a fixed order,
// and it is the opposite of what we shipped:
//
//   COLLAPSE WHOLE SEGMENTS FIRST; CUT CHARACTERS ONLY OUT OF WHAT SURVIVES.
//
//   - IBM Carbon, Breadcrumb usage: "When space becomes limited, use an
//     overflow menu to truncate the breadcrumbs" — and for the narrowest
//     viewports, "start with the overflow first, followed by one breadcrumb",
//     i.e. literally `… / current`.
//     https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/breadcrumb/usage/
//   - Microsoft WinUI BreadcrumbBar (what Windows 11's address bar is):
//     "the breadcrumbs collapse and an ellipsis replaces the leftmost nodes.
//     Clicking the ellipsis opens a flyout to show the collapsed nodes." No
//     intra-node trimming is documented at all.
//     https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/ui/controls/breadcrumbbar
//   - Adobe Spectrum is the explicit prohibition on what we were doing:
//     "Don't truncate multiple labels simultaneously."
//     https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/breadcrumbs/
//   - Grafana's nested-folder breadcrumb spec is the most complete published
//     ladder and is the one this function follows: collapse the centre items,
//     then the first-level item, then the parent of the current page, and only
//     THEN centre-truncate the current page itself. Their stated reason for
//     centre rather than end is ours exactly: "a simple end truncation isn't
//     all that useful given the types of naming schemes people use."
//     https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/62266
//
// SO THE COLLAPSE HAS TO BE MEASURED, not structural. The predecessor's own
// comment argued the opposite ("measuring would let a wide pane show more, at
// the cost of a layout pass") and that reasoning is what produced the bug: a
// cell count tuned for one width is wrong at every other width, and this pane
// is drag-resizable from 180px to 640px. A single ResizeObserver on the strip
// (FileTree.vue) is the whole cost, and it fires on splitter drags, not on
// navigation.
//
// WHY THE LAST SEGMENT IS PROTECTED BUT NOT SACRED. The formal breadcrumb
// systems forbid touching it (Fluent 2's last item is non-interactive and
// never truncated; GitLab Pajamas truncates "all but the last breadcrumb item
// ... to 128px"). But those live in containers that can grow or wrap, and this
// one cannot. The systems that render real filesystem paths in a box that
// genuinely cannot grow protect the tail by BUDGET instead: GNOME Nautilus's
// path bar gives ancestors 7 characters and the current directory 4x that
// (`nautilus-pathbar.c`, `NAUTILUS_PATH_BAR_BUTTON_ELLISPIZE_MINIMUM_CHARS`),
// and Grafana reaches the current page only after three collapse stages have
// failed. Here the budget is "everything that is left", which is the same idea
// at its limit: the current folder is cut only when it alone does not fit, and
// nothing else is ever cut at all.
//
// WHY THE ELLIPSIS IS A MENU AND NOT A TOOLTIP. NN/g's tooltip guidance rules
// tooltips out as the SOLE route to something you need: "is the information in
// the tooltip necessary for users in order to complete a task? If the answer
// is no, a tooltip is well-suited. Otherwise, the information should be present
// on the screen" — and a hidden path segment is a navigation target, not a
// nicety. Carbon, Fluent, Primer, Spectrum and Atlassian all put the collapsed
// items in a menu. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tooltip-guidelines/
//
// WHAT WAS REJECTED, AND WHY:
//
//   - VS Code's answer (`breadcrumbsWidget.ts` wraps the items in a
//     `DomScrollableElement` and calls `reveal(items[items.length - 1])`) is a
//     horizontally scrolling strip with the tail pinned: nothing is ever
//     collapsed and nothing is ever ellipsized. It is the cleanest design in
//     the survey and it does not fit here — a 250px strip that scrolls needs
//     an affordance saying so, NN/g #9-#10 and LogRocket both flag horizontal
//     scroll as a dexterity cost, and the ancestors would be reachable only by
//     a gesture. Note that VS Code itself concedes the narrow case with
//     `breadcrumbs.filePath: "last"` — "Only show the last element of the file
//     path" — which is exactly the terminal state this ladder reaches.
//   - Nautilus's per-ancestor middle ellipsis (7 chars) is the closest thing
//     to a licence for the old behaviour, but it is paid for by a path bar
//     that scrolls and by a tooltip on every button; dropping the ancestor
//     whole and putting it in the menu says the same thing without inventing a
//     name like `v…previews` that matches no directory on the host.
//   - A per-item character cap (Fluent's 30, Pajamas' 128px) needs a container
//     where 30 characters is a small fraction of the width. Here the entire
//     strip is about 22 characters.
//
// Everything hidden stays reachable three ways regardless: the `…` menu, the
// `title` on the strip, and the editable path bar (the pencil, or Ctrl+L).

/**
 * Average advance of one character of `--fs-200` in `--font-ui` (Inter 12px),
 * rounded UP.
 *
 * An estimate, deliberately, and deliberately generous. The alternative is
 * measuring each candidate string in a canvas or a hidden element, which buys
 * exactness we cannot spend: the fit decision is "does this whole segment
 * survive", so being a few pixels pessimistic drops one more ancestor into a
 * menu that is one click away, while being optimistic pushes the current
 * folder under `overflow: hidden`. Round the error towards the harmless side.

/**
 * Turn an absolute path into breadcrumb cells that fit `width` pixels on one
 * line, collapsing whole segments — never characters — until they do.
 *
 * See the block above for the sources; the ladder it implements is:
 *
 *   1. Everything fits, so show everything. (VS Code's whole design, and
 *      Carbon's "The full breadcrumb path should remain visible when there's
 *      enough horizontal space".)
 *   2. Otherwise reserve the `…` FIRST. It is the only route back to what is
 *      about to be hidden, so it outranks every segment it stands for.
 *   3. Reserve the root next, BEFORE any ancestor competes for the space. It
 *      is one character wide and it is the only cell that says which
 *      machine-relative anchor you are under; Grafana's ladder likewise keeps
 *      `Home` through every stage. Reserving it first is also what makes the
 *      strip monotonic under a splitter drag — if ancestors were filled first
 *      they could eat the 16px the root wanted, so widening the pane by four
 *      pixels could take the `~` AWAY. Spectrum lets even the root fall into
 *      the menu when it truly does not fit ("regardless of showRoot"), and so
 *      does this, but only at the very bottom.
 *   4. Fill ancestors right-to-left with what is left, whole names only. A
 *      name that does not fit goes into the menu; it is never shortened, and
 *      what survives is always an unbroken run ending at the current folder —
 *      a gap between two shown cells would name a parent that is not the
 *      parent.
 *   5. Only now, and only for the current folder, does text get cut — by
 *      `splitLabel` in the template, which keeps the tail. That is the last
 *      rung of Grafana's ladder and it applies to exactly one label.
 *
 * @param cwd     absolute remote directory
 * @param home    the login home, or '' when it is not resolved yet
 * @param options `width` is the pixels available to the crumb strip. Omitted
 *                (or non-finite) means "not measured yet", and an unmeasured
 *                strip shows the whole path rather than guessing — a first
 *                paint that collapses and then expands is worse than one that
 *                clips for a frame.
