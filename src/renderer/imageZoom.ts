 * 100% MEANS ONE IMAGE PIXEL PER CSS PIXEL
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Not "fits the window" — that is the Fit mode and it is a value of its own
 * (`fitPercent`), computed from the decoded size and the pane the image sits
 * in. The three states a user can name are all here:
 *
 *   - Fit: the whole image visible at once, never UPSCALED past 100% (the
 *     `max-width` behaviour the viewer shipped with, kept as the default so
 *     opening an image looks the same as it always did);
 *   - 100%: actual size, where a pixel of the file is a pixel on screen —
 *     the setting people mean by "reset";
 *   - everything else: a manual percentage, where the pane scrolls because
 *     the image is allowed to be bigger than it.
 *
 * Fit may land BELOW the minimum below — a 20000 px panorama in a 900 px
 * pane fits at 4.5% — and that is not a violation: the bounds bound the
 * CONTROLS (slider travel, +/- steps), not the honest answer to "what fits".
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the ladder, the clamp, the fit arithmetic and
 * the slider mapping can be tested without a window, exactly as `zoom.ts`
 * does for the app-wide zoom.

 * than a device pixel apart, so anything lower shows a blurrier picture for
 * no reachable inspection need — and a floor the fit answer can dip under
 * (see above) must not be so low that "zoom out" from fit feels broken.
 * 1600 at the top: 16x is where a 1 px feature fills a 128 px pane, which is
