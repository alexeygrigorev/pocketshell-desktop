/**
 * Unhandled renderer errors, recorded once and shown once.
 *
 * The gap this fills is the usage panel's old failure mode: a component that
 * threw during render left Vue's patch aborted, and the user saw a blank panel
 * — no message, no log line, nothing to paste. A packaged app has no console,
 * so "check devtools" is not an answer either.
 *
 * Two sinks, both best-effort:
 *   - `api.diag.log` forwards to the main process, which writes the same
 *     desktop log every exec lands in — the artifact a user is asked to paste;
 *   - `diagErrors` drives the app-wide strip (DiagBanner in App.vue), so the
 *     failure is visible at the moment it happens.
 *
 * Reporting is deliberately swallow-everything: code that runs because
 * something else already failed must not be able to make things worse.
