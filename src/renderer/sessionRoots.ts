 * The phone calls these WATCHED ROOTS and stores them per host in a Room table
 * (`project_roots`: `{hostId, label, path}`, ProjectRootEntity.kt:26-32). The
 * desktop stores them in `stores/settings.ts`, keyed by the SSH config alias.
 * A root is written home-relative (`~/git`), but that spelling does not mean
 * the directory exists on every host; the alias is the stable instance
 * identity that keeps one box's layout out of another's.
 *
 * Matching semantics are ported from FolderTreeProjection.kt verbatim, because
 * that is the behaviour the user already knows from the phone:
 *   - prefix match on a `/` boundary, so `~/git` never claims `~/gitlab`
 *     (`pathWithinRoot`, :310);
 *   - longest match wins when roots nest, first-registered breaking a tie
 *     (`bestRootForPath`, :475);
 *   - a session sitting exactly ON the root belongs to it;
 *   - anything matching no root goes to `other`, pinned last (:276);
 *   - a registered root with no sessions still renders (:179-241).
 *
 * Three deliberate divergences, all recorded in docs/SESSIONLIST.md §12:
 *   - the phone's no-roots fallback dumps EVERYTHING into `Other folders`
 *     (:253-274). We keep deriving roots from `$HOME` instead, so a user who
 *     has configured nothing sees exactly what they saw before.
 *   - the phone dedupes roots by their STORED spelling, so `~/git` and
 *     `/home/me/git` survive as two identical-looking nodes. We dedupe on the
 *     resolved key, so they cannot.
 *   - the phone collapses a session's directory to the FIRST segment under its
 *     root (`projectPathUnderRoot`, :538). We keep the full directory the
 *     session actually runs in; see §12 for the argument, which is close.

 * (src/main/projects/sessionName.ts). So `~/git/red-stamp-sound` becomes
 * `git-red-stamp-sound`, and the leading component of the name is the root the

 * It recovers the ROOT ONLY, never the directory, because the derivation is
 * not invertible past the first component: `-` is both the component separator
 * AND a legal character inside a component, so `git-dtc-website-import` is
 * genuinely ambiguous between `~/git/dtc-website-import` and
 * `~/git/dtc-website/import`. Inventing a directory row from that guess would

 * child of its root instead.
