 * The launch-time "should we dial a host by ourselves?" decision.

 * HostPickerView. Two reasons:
 *
 *   - The rules are all about states the component cannot easily be put into
 *     from a test — a default naming a host that was deleted from ~/.ssh/config,
 *     a second visit to the picker after the user pressed Back, a picker
 *     mounted while a connection is still live. Each is one call here.
 *   - Getting it wrong is not a cosmetic bug. Re-deciding "connect" on every
 *     mount would mean pressing Back from the workspace bounces the user
 *     straight back into it, which is a trap with no exit.

 *      a plain skip rather than an error: a host can be renamed or removed from
 *      ~/.ssh/config at any time, and the app finding out at launch is normal.
 *      The stored value is left alone so the user can see what it was and fix
 *      it, rather than having it silently rewritten under them.
