/**
 * Does the FAR END know how big we are?
 *
 * `terminalRefit.test.ts` next door pins the other half of this: whether a
 * `fit()` is asked for at all when the cell or the viewport changes. It cannot
 * see this half, because its fake `fit()` only counts calls — xterm's
 * dimensions never move in it, so `onResize` never fires and the question of
 * what reached the PTY never arises.
 *
 * It arises constantly in the real app, and it is the bug the user reported
 * twice: a tmux status line sitting eighteen rows above the bottom of the pane
 * with the same stale line repeated underneath. That picture means xterm has
 * more rows than the PTY was ever told about — tmux drew its status line where
 * it believed the screen ended and never touched anything below, so those rows
 * still hold whatever the renderer last put there.
 *
 * The two ways geometry failed to arrive, both pinned below:
 *
 *   1. A resize that fires with NO SHELL TO SEND IT TO. A tab joins by opening
 *      an SSH channel, a login shell and `tmuxctl` — 1.5-2 s on the user's
 *      host — and the pane is laid out during that window. The old handler
 *      read `if (shellId)` and dropped it, and `showTarget` then sent the
 *      cols/rows it had captured BEFORE the await. The far end was told a size
 *      the pane no longer had, permanently, because from xterm's side nothing
 *      was going to change again.
 *
 *   2. A size that is right here and stale there. A tab that comes back into
 *      view at the size it was hidden at produces no `onResize` at all, so
 *      nothing was sent — even though its tmux client may have been resized by
 *      something else entirely in the meantime.
 *
 * So these tests drive the geometry rather than counting fits: the fake
 * FitAddon writes a controllable size onto the fake Terminal and fires its
 * `onResize` listeners exactly as xterm does, and the assertions are about the
 * `api.shell.resize` / `api.shell.redraw` calls that came out of the far side.
