/**
 * Pasting into the terminal, and why one keystroke used to paste twice.
 *
 * ## What was measured
 *
 * Driven in the real Electron runtime this app ships, against a real xterm.js
 * terminal, counting what `term.onData` handed the shell for one keypress:
 *
 *     Ctrl+V         -> onData x1, [""]        (SYN — xterm's own
 *                                                     ctrl-letter mapping; this
 *                                                     chord does not paste)
 *     Ctrl+Shift+V   -> onData x2, ["TEXT", "TEXT"]  <-- the bug
 *     right-click    -> onData x1, ["TEXT"]
 *
 * So the renderer SENDS the bytes twice; nothing is echoing them. And it is
 * Ctrl+Shift+V specifically, which is the only chord that pastes at all — the
 * one the component's own header documents, and therefore the one the user was
 * using.
 *
 * ## Why twice
 *
 * `onCustomKey` handles the chord itself (`pasteFromClipboard()` ->
 * `term.paste()`) and returns false. Returning false stops XTERM — its
 * `_keyDown` bails at the custom handler — but it does NOT cancel the DOM
 * event, and xterm's `_keyDown` has no `cancel()` on that path. Chromium then
 * performs its own default action for Ctrl+Shift+V (paste as plain text),
 * which fires a `paste` event on xterm's textarea, which xterm's own paste
 * listener turns into a second `onData`. One keystroke, two paths, two writes.
 *
 * This is the identical defect the typing intercept had two branches earlier in
 * the same function, fixed in 1dffa87 and pinned by terminalTypingIntercept.test.ts —
 * "one keystroke, two paths", where the second path was the browser typing the
 * character into the composer it had just opened. The comment there explains
 * the mechanism; this is the same mechanism, on the clipboard chord.
 *
 * The fix is the same one line: `e.preventDefault()` before handling. Verified
 * in Electron — with it, Ctrl+Shift+V is onData x1 and right-click stays x1.
 *
 * ## Why one test here is skipped
 *
 * `onCustomKey` lives in TerminalView.vue, which was being edited concurrently
 * by another change when this was written, so the one-line fix is delivered as
 * a diff rather than applied here. The skipped case below IS that fix's
 * assertion; un-skip it when the diff lands. The rest of this file passes
 * either way and pins the parts that are already right, so a future edit cannot
 * quietly take them away.
 *
 * As with the typing intercept, the assertion is `defaultPrevented` rather than
 * a byte count: jsdom performs no default action, so it cannot produce the
 * second paste at all. What it can assert is the thing that makes the second
 * paste impossible.
 *
 * ## Both chords now go to the composer, and the shell keeps the right-click
 *
 * Plain Ctrl+V was claimed for the PROMPT COMPOSER first: the user asked that
 * pasting at the terminal put the clipboard in the composer — an image as a
 * staged attachment, text as draft content — rather than into the shell. The
 * measurement above is what made that affordable: Ctrl+V never pasted anything
 * here, it only produced `\x16`, so nothing the user could previously do with
 * it was taken away except readline's literal-next (`quoted-insert`).
 *
 * Ctrl+SHIFT+V has now followed it, on a second report: "when I paste using
 * ctrl+shift+v it goes directly to terminal but should go to prompt composer".
 * That is the chord every terminal emulator trains into the hand, so it is the
 * one reached for FIRST — and a pane where one paste chord opens the composer
 * while its twin feeds the shell is not two features, it is a coin toss the
 * user cannot call until the clipboard has already landed somewhere. One of
 * those landings hands whatever was on the clipboard to a shell.
 *
 * So the split is no longer chord-vs-chord, it is KEYBOARD-vs-MOUSE: both
 * chords announce `paste-into-composer`, and the right-click is the whole of
 * the shell's paste. The tests below are written the other way up from how they
 * started — what they now guard is that NEITHER chord reaches `term.paste`,
 * and that the right-click still does.
 *
 * The `preventDefault` assertions are unchanged and matter more than before.
 * Ctrl+Shift+V is `pasteAndMatchStyle` in Chromium's default menu; leaving the
 * event live would let the browser paste into whatever holds focus, which a
 * moment later is the composer's draft — the doubled paste of 3628090 arriving
 * at a new destination.
