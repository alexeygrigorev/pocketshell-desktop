/**

 * The user's ask was one sentence — "a `+` near git, near tmp, and just a plus
 * to create a random session in any place; then we don't need 'new session'
 * button anymore" — and it contains a removal, which is what these tests are
 * really guarding. Deleting the foot button is only safe while both `+`s
 * exist, so the properties checked here are:
 *
 *   1. **There is always a way to create a session.** The header's `+` renders
 *      before the session list has loaded, on a host with no sessions at all,
 *      and on a host that failed to resolve `$HOME`. A panel that can show
 *      "no sessions" and no way to make one is the state the removal could
 *      have introduced.
 *   2. **A root's `+` starts the picker IN that root**, expanded to a real
 *      absolute path — not at `$HOME`, and never at the literal `~/git`, which
 *      SFTP would read as a directory named `~`.
 *   3. **`other` has no `+`**, because it is a bucket rather than a directory.
 *   4. **An EMPTY registered root has one**, which is the case the whole
 *      feature is most useful for: a root registered in Settings that nothing
 *      is running in yet.
 *
 * The dialog itself is stubbed. What matters at this seam is which folder it
 * is handed, and NewSessionDialog's own behaviour (browse, derive, start) is
 * not this component's to prove.
