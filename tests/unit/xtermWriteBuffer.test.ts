/**
 * The write-loop recovery, against the REAL xterm internals.
 *
 * `@xterm/headless` is the same CoreTerminal the renderer's Terminal is built
 * on, minus the DOM — including `WriteBuffer`, the component that dies when a
 * parser handler throws. That death is the whole subject, so the test does
 * not fake it: it registers a CSI handler that throws (the same sync-throw
 * path `reverseIndex` took in the production incident), lets the exception
 * escape into Node's `uncaughtException` exactly as it escapes into the
 * renderer's window `error` handler, and holds the recovery to account: the
 * loop parses again — proven the only way the loop's health is observable,
 * write callbacks firing again.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: that bytes written after the recovery land
 * verbatim. They cannot. The throw left the parser mid-escape-sequence, and
 * xterm interprets the next chunk's head bytes as that sequence's
 * continuation — a test run measured it (` p` of a following ` probe` got
 * eaten as the intermediate+final of a half-entered CSI). That corruption is
 * why the pane's recovery does not stop at the resume: the caller follows it
 * with a fresh join, whose `reset()` re-initialises the parser from a known
 * state. This test pins the loop; TerminalView owns the repair.
 *
 * It is also the guard on `resumeWriteBufferAfterError`'s shape checks: run
 * against an upgraded xterm whose internals moved, the false-return path is
 * what must happen — a recovery that half-applies is worse than none.
