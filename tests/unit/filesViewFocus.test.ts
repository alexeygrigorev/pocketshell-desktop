/**
 * The Files pane's half of the workspace's focus handoff, and the placement
 * of the open file's error line.
 *
 * FolderWorkspaceView.focusActiveTab() calls `filesRef.value?.focus?.()` when
 * a Files tab is selected, and types the ref optionally because the call is
 * an ASK the pane may decline. Before the fix the ask reached nothing at all:
 * FilesView exposed no `focus`, so after a click or a Ctrl+Tab the keyboard
 * stayed on the tab button and the pane's own chords (Ctrl+S / Ctrl+L /
 * Ctrl+F, bound via @keydown on the root) were dead until the user clicked
 * inside the pane. These tests pin the contract from this side of the seam:
 *
 *   1. the root is focusable — but at `tabindex="-1"`, so a keyboard user
 *      walking the page never lands on a container that is not a control;
 *   2. `focus()` puts the keyboard on the pane when nothing unsaved is open;
 *   3. `focus()` DECLINES — does nothing, not blur — while an editor holds
 *      unsaved content, which is the workspace comment's own words: moving
 *      the caret out of a dirty buffer to a tree the user did not ask for
 *      would be worse than doing nothing.
 *
 * The fourth case is the other Files defect fixed alongside: a failed save's
 * reason renders in the EDITOR area, beside the bar the user is watching,
 * rather than in the tree footer of the other pane. The store split is pinned
 * in filesStore.test.ts; what belongs here is that the view actually renders
 * the new channel where the eyes are.
 *
 * FileTree and CodeEditor are stubbed at the module seam: the tree's own
 * behaviour has its own suites, and CodeMirror is ~680 KB of machinery this
 * file would load only to ignore.
