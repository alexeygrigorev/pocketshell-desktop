/**
 * The pool's job is deciding, per attach, between two outcomes: hand back the
 * client this session already has, or open one — evicting another tab's client
 * first if the connection is out of SSH channels. That decision is what these
 * cover; the join command itself is pinned in attachCommand.test.ts and
 * exercised against real tmux in tests/integration/TmuxSessionTabs.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THESE TESTS LOOK DIFFERENT
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * This file used to assert the opposite invariant — "one PTY, three sessions" —
 * because the pool held a single client per connection and moved it with
 * `tmux switch-client`. Measured on a real host that cost p50 210 ms when it
 * worked and a full re-join when it did not, which was most of the time; the
 * numbers are in the header of TmuxClientPool. The pool now keeps a client per
 * session tab, so the property worth pinning is that a repeat attach touches
 * NOTHING, and the cost that has to stay bounded is channels rather than time.
 *
 * The fake stands in for SshService rather than for ssh2: the pool only ever
 * touches three things on it (openTrackedShell, shellClose, shellTracker), and
 * stubbing at that seam keeps the test about pooling rather than about channel
 * plumbing.
