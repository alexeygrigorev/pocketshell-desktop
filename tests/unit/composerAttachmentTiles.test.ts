/**
 * Which tiles offer to be annotated.
 *
 * The gate is the interesting part, and it is easy to get wrong in a way that
 * looks fine on the day it lands. The obvious rule — "the tile has a
 * thumbnail" — passes for the pasted screenshot everyone tests with and fails
 * for exactly the same file attached through the paperclip, because attaching
 * by PATH never mints a preview. It also fails for every attachment after a
 * restart, since previews are deliberately not persisted (they can be
 * megabytes). Keying off the remote NAME, through the same classifier the
 * Files tab uses, is what makes those three cases agree.
