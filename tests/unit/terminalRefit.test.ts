/**
 * The re-fit, which is the part of a size change that reaches the far end.
 *
 * Two bugs already fixed in this app came from a grid computed against a cell
 * that had since changed: the sliced tmux status line (7d7cdad) and the
 * font-size wiring (4c0f555). The failure is nasty because it is silent on
 * this side — xterm keeps painting a perfectly nice terminal, at the wrong
 * size — while the PTY on the far end is never told, so tmux goes on drawing
 * to the old geometry and the row the user reads to know which session they
 * are in is the one that gets clipped.
 *
 * Zoom is the third route into the same failure and the reason this file
 * exists: it does not change the cell in CSS px at all, it changes how many
 * cells the window holds. Same wrong grid, same untold PTY.
 *
 * These tests assert the SCHEDULING rather than the resulting cols/rows,
 * because jsdom lays nothing out — there is no cell to measure. That the
 * measurement itself follows from the option assignment was verified against
 * the real xterm 6.0.0 in Electron: 16px -> 24px takes an 800x600 pane from
 * 87x30 to 58x20 and the row box from 19px to 28px, and only after `fit()`.
 * What can regress here, and what these pin, is whether `fit()` is asked for
 * at all.
