/**
 * The lost-link banner in the host workspace.
 *
 * The defect these tests pin down: the connection store has always LEARNED
 * about a dropped transport — its `ssh.onState` subscription flips `state` to
 * 'lost' and its own comment promises "the state flag is enough for the UI to
 * say the link is gone and offer reconnect" — but no view ever rendered any of
 * it. The terminal froze, the file browser listed nothing, and the only
 * user-visible trace was a raw IPC rejection leaking into the session panel's
 * error line. The banner is the missing UI, so the properties held here are:
 *
 *   1. **Silence while the link is up.** A connected host shows no strip at
 *      all — the banner must not become an always-on fixture.
 *   2. **The drop is announced, with the one recovery action attached.** State
 *      'lost' raises the strip, names the host, says the on-screen surfaces
 *      are frozen, and offers Reconnect.
 *   3. **Pressing Reconnect goes through the store**, whose `reconnect()`
 *      already knows the last host and key — the button adds no dialling logic
 *      of its own.
 *   4. **The in-flight state is visible and un-pressable.** A re-dial is
 *      seconds long on a real host; a button that stays pressable would stack
 *      dials.
 *   5. **Success wakes the session panel** by refreshing the sessions store
 *      against the NEW connectionId — the old one is dead on the main side,
 *      and the panel's last poll against it is what wrote the raw rejection.
 *   6. **Failure keeps the banner up**, shows the store's error, and re-arms
 *      the button. This is the case a `state === 'lost'` gate alone cannot
 *      express: a failed connect lands the store on 'idle'.
 *
 * The session panel and the host overlays are stubbed. What is under test is
 * the workspace's own strip and its wiring into the two stores; SessionTree's
 * behaviour has its own file.
