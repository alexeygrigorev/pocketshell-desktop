/**
 * The geometry reconcile loop: the interval that asks tmux what it believes
 * about our geometry, and repairs, repaints, or re-joins depending on the
 * answer.
 *
 * Three failures meet here, and only one of them is a size. The first spelling
 * of this loop compared the WINDOW's height against the xterm grid — measured
 * on tmux 3.4, a session running its status line answers one row short of the
 * PTY forever — so it disagreed on every tick while healthy (a resize-plus-
 * repaint storm every interval) and agreed straight through real drift with
 * the status line off. The comparison now guards the quantity this side
 * controls, the client tty; the window is read to know what the OTHER side is
 * doing; and the state no comparison can see — a pane garbling at constant
 * geometry, curable only by leaving the tab and coming back — is answered by
 * the same move on a clock: one full repaint per healthy interval.
 *
 * As everywhere else in this directory, jsdom lays nothing out, so these tests
 * assert SCHEDULING: which of resize, repaint, close and re-join each answer
 * produces, and that a pane nobody is looking at spends no round trip at all.
