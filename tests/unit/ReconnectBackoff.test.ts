 * The reconnect schedule, all that survives of the old
 * `AutoForwarderSupervisor` (which opened its own second SSH connection —
 * see docs/PORTFWD.md §8). The Python has two contradictory versions of this:
 * the CLI's 5->60s exponential (`forwarder.py:1141`) and the TUI's flat 5s
 * with no backoff at all (`dashboard.py:1036-1038`). We keep the CLI curve.
