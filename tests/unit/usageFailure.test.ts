 * What `[]` from `PocketshellClient.usage` is allowed to mean.
 *
 * `usage()` used to swallow every non-zero exit into an empty list, so a
 * working panel could stop working — expired provider auth, a missing `quse`,
 * a drifted helper — and say only "no usage data — is `pocketshell usage`
 * available on this host?", accusing a helper that was fine while the host's
 * explanation was dropped in the main process.
 *
 * The three-way split held here: exit 0 parses (empty included), a missing
 * binary is still `[]`, and a command that ran and failed throws with the
 * host's line. The renderer half — a rejection becomes the error line and
 * leaves existing rows alone — lives in UsageView.test.ts and
 * agentsStore.test.ts.
