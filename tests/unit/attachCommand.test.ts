 * `can't find session`. The join that replaced it went through `tmuxctl`, and
 * the rename bug then broke THAT: tmuxctl resolves a name against the socket
 * derived from it, so a renamed session answered `was not found` under both
 * names. The join now locates the session's own server host-side and attaches
 * there, keeping `tmuxctl` as the arm for what the sweep cannot see — see
 * src/shared/attachCommand.ts for the four-correction history.
