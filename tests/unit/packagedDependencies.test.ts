/**
 * What is allowed into the installer, executed rather than remembered.
 *
 * electron-builder copies production `dependencies` (and their transitive
 * trees) into the packaged app's node_modules, and leaves `devDependencies`
 * behind. The renderer, meanwhile, is bundled by Vite into out/renderer and
 * carries its own copy of everything it imports — so a renderer library listed
 * in `dependencies` ships TWICE: once compiled into the bundle, once as raw
 * source nothing will ever `require`.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `c2fe2bb` put twenty `@codemirror/*` packages in
 * `dependencies` "to match this repo's convention", because vue, pinia and
 * `@xterm/*` were already there — and the convention was itself the bug. The
 * package trees involved come to roughly 22 MB on disk. `keytar` and
 * `ssh2-sftp-client` were worse than that: both were in `dependencies`,
 * neither was imported by a single line of this app, and keytar is a native
 * module, so every `npm run dist` stopped to rebuild a binary nobody loads.
 *
 * The rule this file enforces is therefore not "keep the list short". It is:
 *
 *     `dependencies` means REQUIRED FROM DISK BY THE PACKAGED APP.
 *     Anything `import`ed by the renderer, or by main via a bundled path,
 *     belongs in `devDependencies` — it is a build input, not a shipped file.
 *
 * A new entry here is a claim that something reads it out of node_modules at
 * runtime. Write the reason next to it in ALLOWED, and the test passes.
