/**
 * A client per session tab, against the real thing: real tmux, real tmuxctl,
 * real sshd.
 *
 * The unit tests pin what the pool DECIDES. Only this can say whether the
 * decision works on a host — whether several tmux clients can sit on one server
 * at once without disturbing each other's sessions or each other's geometry,
 * whether returning to a tab really costs no bytes, and whether `sshd`'s
 * `MaxSessions` leaves room for the rest of the app.
 *
 * This file replaces TmuxSwitch.integration.test.ts, which tested the design
 * this one supersedes: one client per connection, moved with
 * `tmux switch-client`. That design's own numbers on the user's host are in the
 * header of TmuxClientPool — a switch that worked cost p50 210 ms and most did
 * not work — and its cost is structural, since a switch is an SSH exec channel
 * plus a full-screen repaint. Keeping the tab's client removes both.
 *
 * The helper image is used rather than `:tmux` because tmuxctl is what the join
 * runs. Auto-skips when Docker is unavailable.
