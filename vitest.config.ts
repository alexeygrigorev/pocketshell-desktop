// than only through its store. It compiles `.vue` files and is inert for every
// other test. The suite's default environment stays `node`; the handful of
// specs that need a DOM opt in per file with `@vitest-environment jsdom`, which
// keeps the cost of jsdom off the ~30 tests that have no use for it.

  // in both and nominally different, so tsc rejects the value that works

  // pointed at the version this file is actually type-checked against.
